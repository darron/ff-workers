Engaged couple shot dead fleeing landlord after house dispute near Hamilton, Ont., police say
Toronto
Engaged couple shot dead fleeing landlord after house dispute near Hamilton, Ont., police say
A “truly innocent” engaged couple was shot dead while attempting to flee their attacker outside their home after a landlord-tenant dispute escalated on Saturday night, according to Hamilton police.  Officers said a 27-year-old female and 28-year-old male who were engaged to be married were shot dead outside their residence at 322 Jones Rd., near Barton Street, in Stoney Creek, on Saturday at around 5:40 p.m. after a disagreement surrounding issues within the house.  Hamilton police on scene after a landlord-tenant dispute left three dead in a residence in Stoney Creek. (Simon Sheehan/CP24)&#34;These are not people that this should happen to, they&#39;re not involved in any level of criminality or lifestyle that may lead to an incident like this. They&#39;re truly innocent,&#34; Det. Sgt. Steve Bereziuk said on Sunday.  He said the woman was an educational assistant for the Catholic school board in Brant County, while the man worked as an electrician in Hamilton.  &#34;(They were) both hardworking people, adding to the tragedy of this event,&#34; Bereziuk said, adding that no one involved in this incident was known to police.  On Saturday night, the building’s 57-year-old landlord had barricaded himself in the residence with multiple guns that were registered to him, including handguns and long rifles, according to police.  At approximately 10 p.m., there was an exchange of gunfire between the man and a police officer after hours of attempted negotiations, according to a Special Investigations Unit (SIU) release Sunday.  The man was struck and pronounced deceased at the scene. His death is now under investigation by the SIU, Ontario&#39;s police watchdog.  More than a dozen investigators and officials have been appointed to the case, the SIU said.  Hamilton police provide an update on the double homicide of an engaged couple on Sunday, May 28, 2023 (Simon Sheehan/CP24).   &#39;OUT OF CHARACTER&#39;  Sandra Chaisson, a resident of more than four decades in the area of the incident, said the landlord bought the house on Jones Road from her grandparents.  “He was very quiet. A very quiet man. I didn&#39;t see him much, just to wave hello, but I haven&#39;t seen him for a long time,” she said.  “The tenants were in the basement, but I didn&#39;t know them, just to see them at the mailbox kind of thing,” she said, adding that the incident seemed “out of character.”  Chaisson said she was watching TV a little after 10 p.m. when she heard six to eight rapid shots fired. “It was rather scary,” she said. “It’s a shock to all of us.”       SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon: pic.twitter.com/po1NPDt3C4 — Special Investigations Unit (@SIUOntario) May 28, 2023      At around 10:30 p.m., police asked people in the vicinity to “shelter in their basement as a safety precaution” as negotiators communicated with the suspect “in an attempt to peacefully resolve the incident.”  Hours later, just before 1 a.m., Hamilton police said in a tweet that the situation had been “contained.”  “There is no ongoing risk to public safety. Police will remain in the area for sometime as we continue to investigate. Please continue to avoid the area,” they wrote.  Ontario’s Special Investigation Unit has been called following an interaction with a man believed to be responsible for a double homicide in Stoney Creek. (Simon Sheehan/CP24)  Police said at one point during the negotiations, the man fired at their armoured vehicle. “The suspect later fired additional rounds, which resulted in an interaction with police,” Hamilton police said.  The families of both victims have been notified, but for now the names of the victims are not being released, police said.  Investigators are asking witnesses or anyone with information about the incident to contact Det. Robert DiIanni at 905-546-3836, or Crime Stoppers anonymously.

The man, police say, was suspected of killing a man and a woman who were renters in an east Hamilton home.A neighbourhood in Stoney Creek is &#34;shocked&#34; after &#34;horrifying&#34; events over the weekend that took the lives of a couple in their 20s who police say were renters in an east Hamilton home.Police say a 27-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man were shot and killed by their landlord after a dispute Saturday. When police arrived around 6 p.m., the man had barricaded himself in the home, resulting in a standoff with police that lasted several hours.The man was killed in &#34;an exchange of gunfire&#34; with a police officer, according to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU). Police said the couple — an educational assistant and an electrician who were engaged —  had been shot as they were &#34;fleeing the residence.&#34;&#34;They are truly innocent victims... this is a very tragic incident,&#34; Det. Sgt. Steve Bereziuk told reporters Sunday morning. Ward 10 councillor Jeff Beattie called the scene &#34;pretty horrifying.&#34; &#34;This is a really quiet part of town, not a lot happens here and for three lives to be tragically lost, it&#39;s unbelievable,&#34; he told CBC News Sunday afternoon.Suspect barricaded himself inside homePolice said they were called to the residence at 322 Jones Rd., north of Barton Street in Stoney Creek, after reports of a shooting. They learned a 57-year-old man they say was the landlord had barricaded himself inside the house with several firearms registered to him.&#34;We spent considerable time last night on the phone in attempts to negotiate a peaceful resolution with the male suspect,&#34; Bereziuk said.The SIU said around 10 p.m., there was &#34;an exchange of gunfire between the man and a police officer&#34; and &#34;the man was struck and pronounced deceased.&#34; It said a team of 10 investigators have been assigned to the case and could be seen on site Sunday. SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/po1NPDt3C4&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/po1NPDt3C4&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;@SIUOntarioThe SIU investigates the conduct of police officers when they shoot at someone, as well as incidents involving police that result in death or serious injury.Police said families of both victims have been notified but that the victims&#39;s names would not be released at this time. Dispute over &#39;state of the home&#39;The families &#34;are extremely upset. As you can well imagine, these are not people that this should happen to. They&#39;re not involved in any level of criminality or lifestyle that may lead to an incident like this,&#34; Bereziuk said.He said police continue to investigate what happened exactly before the shooting.&#34;The early indication on that is it sounds like there was some type of dispute regarding the state of the home. The specifics I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get into at this point in time.&#34; Police said it did not involve &#34;a missed rental payment.&#34;Police and investigators with the Special Investigations Unit could be seen outside a home in Stoney Creek Sunday, where three people died, including two tenants and one man who police say had shot them.

Police identify engaged couple shot dead after dispute with landlord near Hamilton

Police identify engaged couple shot dead after dispute with landlord near Hamilton
Hamilton police have identified the couple allegedly shot and killed by their landlord at their Stoney Creek residence last weekend.  On Tuesday, police said 27-year-old Carissa MacDonald of Stoney Creek and 28-year-old Aaron Stone of Hamilton were the victims of the May 27 shooting, which allegedly stemmed from a dispute with their landlord.  MacDonald and Stone were fatally shot outside as they were fleeing the home in the area of Jones Road and Barton Street, police said.  &#34;The families of both victims are requesting privacy at this time,&#34; Hamilton police said in a release on Tuesday.  27-year-old Carissa MacDonald (left) and 28-year-old Aaron Stone of Hamilton have been identified as the victims of a deadly shooting in Stoney Creek, Ont. (Hamilton Police Service)  Few details have been released about the alleged dispute between the landlord and the couple, who lived in the residence’s basement, but police had said that the victims were &#34;truly innocent.&#34;  MacDonald was an education assistant for the Catholic school board in Brant County, while Stone was an electrician in Hamilton.  &#34;As you can well imagine, these are not people that this should happen to. They&#39;re not involved in any level of criminality or lifestyle that may lead to an incident like this,&#34; said Detective Sergeant Steve Bereziuk on Sunday.  Meanwhile, the landlord, a 57-year-old man, was fatally shot by police during an exchange of gunfire, concluding an hours-long standoff on Saturday evening that began after he barricaded himself inside the home.  Police and the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) have not released the man&#39;s name. The SIU said the family requested that he not be identified.  However, property records obtained by CTV News Toronto reveal the home has been owned by Terry Brekka since 2003. A family member on Monday said Brekka was a steelworker who was estranged from some relatives and wasn&#39;t known to have guns.  27-year-old Carissa MacDonald (left) and 28-year-old Aaron Stone of Hamilton have been identified as the victims of a deadly shooting in Stoney Creek, Ont. (Hamilton Police Service)  A post-mortem examination was conducted on the man on Tuesday, the SIU said in an update.  The agency, which is investigating the interaction between the man and Hamilton police, also said that investigators had collected five firearms and one police-issued firearm from the home.  All six firearms will be sent to the Centre of Forensic Sciences for examination. Investigators also retrieved video footage, the SIU said, adding that the scene is still being held.  &#34;A canvass of the area in an attempt to locate evidence and potential witnesses is ongoing,&#34; the agency said.  There are six investigators and four forensic investigators designated to the case as well as one subject official and seven witness officials.  The SIU, which investigates conduct of police that may have resulted in death, serious injury, sexual assault, and/or the discharge of a firearm at a person, is urging anyone who may have information to contact investigators at 1-800-787-8529 or https://siu.on.ca/en/appeals.php.  - with files from Joanna Lavoie and Hannah Alberga
