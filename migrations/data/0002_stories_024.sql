Police have confirmed that two young boys found dead inside their home in Spruce Grove, Alta., were killed by their father, who took his own life after the double murder.
Ryder, 13, and Radek MacDougall, 11, were found dead when their mother, Tracy Stark, and their stepfather Brent arrived at the home on Monday. After knocking on the door and finding no answer, the couple called 911.
On Tuesday night, Spruce Grove RCMP confirmed that the incident was a double murder-suicide.
&#34;This is a horrible tragic loss to Spruce Grove and our hearts and prayer go out to the family,&#34; said Sgt. Jack Poitras in a statement.
Hockey sticks, flowers, toys and cards have been set outside the home in a makeshift memorial to honour the brothers, who are remembered by friends and loved ones as avid hockey players who had a flair for humour.
The father has been identified as 39-year-old Corry MacDougall. The boys’ stepfather told CTV Edmonton that their “beautiful young lives were snuffed out by a coward.”
“These were good, young kids that had a lot of life left in them and it was taken away too soon,” Brent Stark said.
Stark said the boys’ mother was the primary parent, but allowed the children to move in with their father for the school year at their request to pursue sports more seriously.
Stark said there were no warning signs before the deaths.
“None at all. There was no inkling or anything to the fact,” he said.
Guns were seen being removed from the home by police officers, and one said they were being taken in as evidence but would not confirm whether they had anything to do with the deaths.
Friends mourn Ryder and Radek
The sudden deaths have shaken the community. Classmates and teammates stopped by the memorial throughout the day on Tuesday to remember their friends.
A few boys said they last saw Ryder Sunday night when they played hockey together.
“It’s darn near impossible to comprehend it. It shocked me, probably shocked a whole lot of other people,” said Hayden Rake, Ryder’s teammate.
Adam Berthiaume, another teammate, described the older brother as an uplifting presence on the team.
“He was really funny. Whenever the team was down, he brought us all up again,” Berthiaume said.
Some children stayed home from school Tuesday to cope with the grief. One young girl who stopped by the memorial recalled Radek as someone who “always made everybody laugh.”
She picked out blue roses to place at the memorial, she says, because “that was one of his favourite colours.”
A trauma team was set up at the boys’ school, Greystone Centennial Middle School, to help staff and students cope with the grief. The school lowered its flag to remember the young brothers.
“I think we try to keep as much normalcy as possible, but we certainly have opportunities if students need to step out and cope in a different way. We have the people there to help deal with that,” said Eric Cameron, chair of the Parkland School Division Board.
Condolences pour in
Candlelight vigils have been organized across the community to remember boys. One was planned at Tracy Stark’s home in Whitecourt, Alta. on Tuesday, and another has been planned for Thursday at a hockey arena.
A neighbour who lived across the street from the MacDougalls said his sons were close friends with the boys, and he spent the day with his children honouring Ryder and Radek.
“We just wanted to head out to the outdoor rink and play a bit of shinny and shoot the puck around a little bit and remember the boys,” said neighbour Jarl Nome.
Since Monday, messages of condolences have flooded Tracy Stark&#39;s Facebook page.
“My heart is breaking for you and your family. Praying for you all,” wrote one Facebook user.
“Our deepest condolences. There are no words for this,” wrote another.

The boys had attended the school since September.

SPRUCE GROVE, Alta. — Corry MacDougall took his two sons to their hockey games, and coaches say nothing seemed amiss, the day before the three were found dead in what police say was a double murder-suicide in their home west of Edmonton.Radek, 11, was on the ice with the Spruce Grove Sabertooths peewee team early Sunday and was disappointed the concession wasn’t yet open so he could buy a big bag of Double Bubble gum that he often passed around to teammates, says coach Brendan Ardron.His big brother, 13-year-old Ryder, played Sunday night with the city’s bantam AA Timberwolves and was benched for part of the second period after a penalty. Coach Dallas Ansell says the quiet and loyal defenceman had improved over the season and was coming out of his shell and cracking jokes.The two coaches and other hockey officials, along with a pastor and a chaplain, gathered with players in an arena room Monday after learning the boys had been killed.
“It’s OK to cry” and “it’s OK to not be OK,” Ansell said he told the young players.

There were lots of tears, added Ardron.“It’s a pretty hard pill to swallow as an adult, let alone when it’s a kid and your friend has passed away for no reason,” he said.“It doesn’t make sense.”RCMP said three bodies were discovered in a home in Spruce Grove early Monday and that officers were not looking for any suspects.The boys’ stepfather, Brent Stark, told local media that he and his wife, Tracy, made the discovery when they arrived to pick up the children. Stark, owner of the Whitecourt Wolverines of the Alberta Junior Hockey League, said the boys had been killed by their father, and called him a coward.A memorial in the snow outside the house included hockey sticks, teddy bears and notes for the family.On Tuesday night, tears streamed down hundreds of faces at a vigil for the boys in front of the Stark home in Whitecourt.Tracy and Brent Stark thanked the crowd for coming, including dozens of their sons’ former teammates sporting Whitecourt minor hockey jerseys.“It’s hard enough for an adult to understand,” the weeping mother told the crowd. “All these kids — I just don’t have an answer. But I know Ryder and Radek are looking down at us.”“We’re at a loss for words,” added Brent Stark. “We don’t know, really, what to say. It’s been a long 48 hours.”A moment of silence was held, followed by close friends and family members lighting Chinese lanterns.Family friend Rodney Koscileny said the entire town is reeling from the tragedy.“I couldn’t go anywhere today in any grocery store .. without everybody crying and talking about this.”The boys had previously played hockey and lived in Whitecourt but moved earlier this year to Spruce Grove, where they joined their new hockey teams and started grades 6 and 8.Radek gave no indication there were problems at home with his father, said Ardron.Corry MacDougall, who was 39, sat quietly during Ryder’s last game, and chatted with a videographer who was recording the play, added Ansell. A parent in the stands said MacDougall also asked her that night about the schedule for a tournament over the Christmas break.The coaches said stickers with the brothers’ hockey numbers — 8 for Radek, 3 for Ryder  — will be on put their teammates’ helmets for the rest of the season. Signed jerseys will also be given to the boys’ mother.Corry MacDougall posted a photo on his Facebook page last year of he and his sons, all three smiling near a lake. The only recent entry was a copy of an Edmonton Oilers logo. He listed himself as owner of two companies called Cemac Compression and Powertec Energy.His aunt, Delores MacDougall in Edson, described him as a kind and doting father and said family members are struggling to explain the deaths.“I don’t know what happened, but that wasn’t him,” she said.“He pedalled those kids to hockey all the time. He loved those kids. That was his life.”She said he and his wife had split years earlier and, although she believes he currently had custody of the boys, she didn’t know if there were plans for it to change.“Corry was a good father and what went wrong, I guess, we’ll never know.”— By Chris Purdy in Edmonton, with files from CIXM The Canadian PressNote to readers: A previous version of this story which moved Monday evening had the ages of the boys reversed.

Court documents outline contentious relationship between parents of slain boys

As residents of Whitecourt and Spruce Grove try to come to terms with the tragic deaths of two boys, whose bodies were found along with their father in a double murder-suicide this week, court documents are providing a glimpse into the tense relationship between their parents.
On Tuesday night, a candlelit vigil was held in Whitecourt in honour of 13-year-old Ryder and 11-year-old Radek MacDougall. The brothers were killed by their father Corry MacDougall in a double murder-suicide.
That evening, the boys’ mother Tracy Stark spoke at the gathering.
“It is hard enough for an adult to understand, to all these kids, we just don’t have an answer, nor do we, but I just, I know Ryder and Radek are looking down,” Stark said.
A family friend told CTV News that Stark, and her husband Brent, are inconsolable.
“They’re not even in a shock phase right now, they’re entirely numb,” Rodney Koscielny said.
Documents obtained by CTV News show tension between the divorced biological parents of two young boys, who were found slain in a Spruce Grove home this week.
The documents for MacDougall and Stark’s case outline their tumultuous relationship – including disputes over custody, visitation, and child care payments.
MacDougall had no criminal record, but those extensive documents also contained concerning allegations, Stark alleged the father of her sons had anger issues, and that she and the boys were scared of him.
In a 2014 affidavit, which has not been proven in court, Stark wrote:
“Not only are the children afraid of [their dad], but I am also. I believe [Corry] to be very unstable, with admitted anger issues.”
Three accounts in an affidavit dated June, 2014 outlined violent incidents:
In one case, Stark said she “cooked a frozen shepherd’s pie for dinner, and when [MacDougall] came home, he threw the dinner at the wall saying he doesn’t work all day to eat a frozen meal.”
When Ryder was two years old, Stark said “[MacDougall] threw our Christmas tree out the window, leaving me to pick up the broken tree and ornaments off the ground.”
Finally, Stark said she came home “after a night out with friends” to find “a casserole dish thrown at the wall, with the broken ceramic pieces and food littering the floor.”
There are no recent court documents to show there has been conflict in 2016.
Stark’s husband told CTV News his stepsons had just started living with their father in Spruce Grove at the start of the school year in the fall to accommodate their hockey schedules.
“We are at a loss for words, we don’t know what to say,” Brent Stark said.
Another memorial for the two boys is scheduled to take place Thursday night at the Stu Barnes Arena in Spruce Grove at 6 p.m.

SPRUCE GROVE, AB — The mother of two boys killed by their father in a murder-suicide earlier this week took to Facebook to clarify the custody arrangement between her and the father.In a post on Facebook responding to a story in the Edmonton Journal, Tracy Stark said she had full custody of her sons Ryder, 13, and Radek, 11, MacDougall with their stepfather Brent Stark. Ryder and Radek were found dead in a home in Spruice Grove on Monday by their stepfather Brent Stark. The body of their father Corry MacDougall, 39, was also found in the home. RCMP have confirmed the death was a murder-suicide committed by Corry.“I will clear one thing up … this monster didn’t have primary care!!! He was given one school year with these boys so they could play hockey in Spruce Grove … I raised these babies with my husband Brent in Whitecourt their entire lives … he had 4 months with them and he took them away,” Stark wrote on Facebook.Insp. Gibson Glavin with the  wouldn’t comment on how the boys died.
“The adult was responsible, criminally responsible, for the deaths of the two boys,” he told Global News on Wednesday.

“After we’ve had an opportunity to collect what evidence is available where the event happened and talk to the people who can tell us anything they know about what happened and get the reports from the medical examiner, we turn now to looking back. Was there anything that indicated that something could have been happening to prevent this that police could have been a part of, should have been a part of?”Glavin said the investigation is not closed by any means.“It’s not open because we don’t know what occurred; it’s open because we want to understand what occurred better,” he said.He said it was a “very tough” scene for investigators, but added it is their professional duty to work the case and provide answers for the family and community.The boys played with the Spruce Grove Minor Hockey Association, whose president posted a statement online calling the deaths an “unimaginable tragedy.”They were both students at the nearby Greystone Centennial Middle School, who have activated a trauma team to help students cope with the tragedy.A vigil for the boys was held Tuesday in Whitecourt.
