EDMONTON – The last time Gavin Joseph Mandin was free, he was a 15-year-old boy with large round glasses, a child’s face, and acne-speckled skin.
Now he’s 36 and has spent more than half of his life in prison for the brutal and unexplained murders of his mother, stepfather and two sisters at the family home near Valleyview in August 1991.After 21 years in prison, Mandin was granted day parole by the National Parole Board on Oct. 31.Correctional Service of Canada and the National Parole Board would not comment on where Mandin will be living, or whether he has returned to Alberta. His parole reports come from the Ontario region.Mandin now goes by the name Gavin Ian Maclean, taking the name of his biological father as his middle and last names.									Story continues below advertisement
The murders happened on Aug. 6, 1991, moments after Mandin’s mother, Susan, 41, stepfather Maurice, 46, and sisters Islay, 12, and Janelle 10, pulled into the driveway of the family’s vacation home near Valleyview after a shopping trip. Inside the small three-room farmhouse, Mandin picked up a loaded .22-calibre rifle.“Some part of me took over,” he later said. “My dad got out of the car and I just kept shooting at him. I was enraged. I called my sister’s name and she looked at me and I didn’t have any conscious intent of doing anything, but the gun slung towards her and shot her.”

Mandin fired 10 times and killed all four people, shooting each of his sisters in the head from barely an inch away. He waited for his mother to look up at him before he killed her.The teen fired until he was out of bullets, and kept pulling the trigger even after the gun was empty.Afterward, Mandin got a knife and cut open his mother’s flowered blue dress, her bra and panties, leaving her body exposed. He tied his stepfather’s body to the back of an ATV and dragged it into some long summer grass, then drove the car with his mother and sisters’ bodies into the trees.Mandin stayed on the property for more than a day before packing up the family’s copper-coloured minivan with clothing, a cooler, two knives, a shotgun, and the rifle he’d used in the shootings. An avid reader and science fiction fan, he also took the Ray Bradbury mystery novel A Graveyard for Lunatics.									Story continues below advertisement
Police who tried to pull Mandin over were concerned only about his driving, and had no idea anyone had been hurt.Mandin was arrested after a high-speed chase, and later confessed the murders to police. He told officers he was planning to go home to St. Albert, and was then thinking of going up north “where nobody would have been able to find me.”The crime was shocking not only for its violence, but also for its senselessness. Mandin himself seemed unable to explain what he had done.“People keep coming up to me and saying, ‘why?’ I look back and think I was a pretty screwed-up kid … an egotistical power maniac,” he told the Journal in 1994. “It doesn’t make sense. At the time, the reasons seemed acceptable. Now I can’t even remember the reasons.”Mandin recalled being annoyed at having to do chores, feeling like a “slave,” and being put off by “the entire attitude of the household.”He told police after his arrest: “It was just anger building up over the years and the opportunity came up.”Those who knew the family also struggled to find an explanation. Mandin was a seemingly normal middle-class teenager, the child of two teachers, with a small but close circle of friends. He had an IQ of 133, in the “superior intelligence” range. He appeared to have a good relationship with his stepfather, Maurice, who had met and married Mandin’s mother about five years before the killings. Mandin’s biological parents divorced when he was a child.									Story continues below advertisement
“Nothing can explain this sudden turnaround that brought on this rage,” Mandin’s uncle Emile said in 1994.Mandin became a born-again Christian shortly after the murders, and was re-baptized while in custody at the Edmonton Young Offender Centre. He pleaded guilty to four counts of second-degree murder and was sentenced as an adult, receiving life in prison without parole for a minimum of 10 years.When Mandin first applied for parole in July 2001, the board declined his release – in large part because of his lack of remorse for the crime.“Remorse has always been a challenge for me,” Mandin told the board at the time.“I recognize how callous it sounds, but I remember the feeling of helplessness … feeling there was no way out.”Another parole report, generated when Mandin successfully applied for unescorted absences from prison in 2009, said he continued to “heap blame” on his mother for many years after the murders. But it also said Mandin had come to a greater understanding of his crime, realizing that he felt “a strong hostility” toward his mother from a very young age, and had started to blame her for all of the negative experiences in his life, while simultaneously craving her love, acceptance and attention.Psychological reports throughout the years have varied. Some early assessments found Mandin was a psychopath, but later reports and testing did not.

A 2007 assessment found Mandin didn’t meet the criteria for such a diagnosis under the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, and a Violent Risk Appraisal Guide test found him a low risk to reoffend violently.The Parole Board decision said the most recent psychological report, prepared in August 2012, found Mandin was a good candidate for day parole because he had done well in prison and had complied with his correctional plan. The person preparing the report did notice “prominent narcissistic and obsessional features which could prove relatively maladaptive” within a community setting, the parole board said.Mandin’s risk for violent reoffence was found to be in the “low moderate” range.In its decision, the board told Mandin: “During your hearing you impressed as being candid and open about why you offended as you did and how you have come to terms with your actions.“You have not been able to rationally explain why you killed your sisters but it appears that you will never fully explain this action.”Mandin has had a few problems in prison and was once caught with contraband pornography and magazines about “a fictional vampire slayer,” but is described by the parole board as being an “exemplary” inmate. The parole reports say Mandin has completed numerous programs, and has worked, saved money, and participated actively in the Lifers’ Club and other inmate groups.									Story continues below advertisement
Under the conditions of his parole, Mandin is only allowed to have contact with one specific family member, who has been a support for him since the slayings.“The other members of the family have been severely traumatized by your actions and do not wish contact with you in any form whatsoever,” the most recent parole decision notes.Mandin must also take counselling, and report any relationships with women.“The act of cutting your mothers clothes after her murder is unexplained and appears in the context of inappropriate sexual fantasies,” the decision reads. “To ensure that any female is protected and is aware of your history, any such relationship must be reported forthwith.”Since he is serving a life sentence, Mandin will continue to be monitored in the community for the rest of his life, and could be re-incarcerated if his parole officer believes there are problems.Mandin’s family declined to be interviewed about his release, but a 2011 parole board report described them as being profoundly devastated.At his first parole hearing in 2001, Mandin’s older stepsister, Monique, said she was afraid of Mandin and dreaded his release from prison.“Honestly, it’s something I’m not even capable of imagining,” she said at that time. “I can’t imagine what my life will be like when he’s released.”									Story continues below advertisement
She described the family’s horror as “asphyxiating.”Sitting down with a Journal reporter after his sentencing hearing in January 1994, Mandin said he wanted to take programs for his anger, to learn to empathize with other people, and “to correct some things that I know are a little crooked in my brain.”Mandin said then the rest of his family didn’t need to be afraid of him, and that he looked ahead to the time of his release, which 19 years later has finally arrived.“When I get out, I’d be content to find a little house somewhere,” he said. “Get married, and live whatever life God wants me to.”

Some information may no longer be current.ShareA young Alberta man who murdered his family 10 years ago was denied parole yesterday.Gavin Mandin was 15 when he shot and killed his mother, stepfather and two sisters at their remote hobby farm near Valleyview, 300 kilometres northwest of Edmonton.Several members of his extended family attended yesterday&#39;s National Parole Board hearing, held at the Bowden Institution, a medium-security jail south of Red Deer. A few read prepared statements opposing his release.In addressing the three-member panel, Mr. Mandin acknowledged he had little chance of being granted parole. He also talked at some length about the rage he felt toward his mother.&#34;At the time I thought I was perfectly justified in what I did,&#34; he said. &#34;I still see myself as a victim.&#34;Mr. Mandin&#39;s aunt, Colette Mandin-Kosowan, said earlier this week she didn&#39;t think anyone in the family was ready for his release.&#34;Those 10 years have just gone by so quickly, it just seems unreal that we&#39;re already here when there&#39;s still grief issues to deal with,&#34; she said.Mr. Mandin told police he committed the Aug. 6, 1991 murders out of anger at having to do chores.In 1993, the teen pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in adult court, but was sentenced under the Young Offenders Act. He received the harshest possible penalty -- life with no parole eligibility for 10 years from the time of the crime.At the time of his guilty plea, his lawyer said he attacked his family as they drove into the yard. He shot his stepfather as he got out of the car and then shot his mother and sisters, 10-year-old Janelle and 12-year-old Islay, in the vehicle.Follow Jill Mahoney on Twitter: @jillsmahoneyOpens in a new windowReport an errorEditorial code of conductYour GlobeBuild your personal news feedMore infoFollow the author of this article:Jill MahoneyFollowYou must be logged in to follow.Log InCreate free accountCheck Following for new articlesTerms &amp; ConditionsCommunity GuidelinesPrivacy PolicyDisclaimerSkip footer navigationSubscribeDigital + Home DeliveryDigital AccessGlobe2GoThe New York TimesGlobe Email NewslettersGift SubscriptionBusiness servicesAdvertise with UsGroup SubscriptionsGlobe CampusContent LicensingDataStoreReport On Business Top 1000Globe Event CentreSophi.ioContact usAddress and Phone NumberPublic EditorStaffStaff PGP DirectorySecureDropSubmit an articleReader servicesMy globeandmail.com AccountTechnical Support &amp; FAQsManage my home deliveryManage my privacy preferencesManage my advertising preferencesMember BenefitsAbout usCompany informationWork at The GlobeAccessibilityEditorial Code of ConductSustainabilityLicensing &amp; PermissionsElection Advertising RegistrySubscribeDigital + Home DeliveryDigital AccessGlobe2GoThe New York TimesGlobe Email NewslettersGift SubscriptionBusiness servicesAdvertise with UsGroup SubscriptionsGlobe CampusContent LicensingDataStoreReport On Business Top 1000Globe Event CentreSophi.ioContact usAddress and Phone NumberPublic EditorStaffStaff PGP DirectorySecureDropSubmit an articleReader servicesMy globeandmail.com AccountTechnical Support &amp; FAQsManage my home deliveryManage my privacy preferencesManage my advertising preferencesMember BenefitsAbout usCompany informationWork at The GlobeAccessibilityEditorial Code of ConductSustainabilityLicensing &amp; PermissionsElection Advertising RegistryReturn to start of footer navigation© Copyright 2023 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Inquest into the Death of Jonathan Yeo: A Personal Perspective
Caveat.org
September 1992
On August 9, 1991, my daughter Nina,
did not return home. I had last seen her that evening when she ran into
the house to fetch some pants that needed tailoring. She was to go from
the tailor to the racquet club to play tennis with her father. &#39;Bye, Mom,&#39;
she called as she ran out the door. That was the last time I saw her.
After Nina&#39;s body was found, and Jonathan Yeo was
identified as the main suspect in her murder, questions emerged about
his release on bail. Barbara Krever, a representative of the Attorney-General,
was quoted in the press on Aug. 23 as saying: &#39;A lawyer for the Crown
did everything humanly and legally possible to make sure Jonathan Yeo
was prohibited from possessing a weapon when granted bail June 7.&#39;
A reading of the transcript of the bail hearing made
this statement not only appear ill-informed but also patently untrue.
When similar statements were publicly endorsed on radio by Attorney-General
Howard Hampton himself on Sept. 18, it became clear there would be no
voluntary investigation into the bail hearing by his office.
Until this time, my family had been wrestling with
personal loss and grief, but it had become apparent that a larger
question was at stake--protection of the public. In Ontario, as in other
provinces, justice is administered by government departments, and it is
extremely difficult for the public to question the decisions made. That
is why we decided to petiton the Federal Government for changes to the
Criminal Code, the Bail Reform Act and the Parole Act.
When we learned there would be a coroner&#39;s inquest,
my husband and I discussed the possibilities of legal representation,
but because the fees quoted were so high and we had sustained a
significant economic loss after Nina&#39;s death, we decided I would ask for
standing at the inquest.
I knew I could not fill a legal function but with the
clarity that comes from experiencing the hell of violent crime, I
realized that all too often the victim is forgotten in the courtroom.
The victim has no face. Here we were investigating the death of the
killer. I did not want the jury to forget for one minute that Karen
Marquis and Nina de Villiers were also part of the equation.
However, after five weeks of acting as counsel for my
family, I decided that I needed expert counsel. Twelve skilled lawyers
were representing the various individuals and departments involved, and
someone equally knowledgeable was needed to cross-examine on Nina&#39;s and
Karen&#39;s behalf, and by extension on behalf of society in general.
In the end it became clear that through their
exhaustive work, Chief Coroner Dr. James Young, inquest counsel Ted
Minden, and Inspector Jack Goodlett of the Ontario Provincial Police,
had done everything possible to hold a sweeping investigation of the
administration of Justice in Ontario. The 137 recommendations of the
jury are spelled out in clear, simple terms and will not require a major
restructuring of justice in Ontario.
However, there is a public perception that inquests
are a cosmetic exercise and that their recommendations are all too
frequently ignored. I too have shared this view. There is no legal
obligation to respond to coroners juries&#39; recommendations. It is time
the Coroner&#39;s Act is given some &#34;teeth &#34;, to quote my lawyer, Mark
Sandler. This inquest has cost an enormous amount of time, commitment,
sacrifice, and above all, taxpayer&#39;s money. It would be a travesty if
the recommendations were not considered and acted on with the same level
of commitment.
Dr. Young, in his summation, discussed the three
steps in solving a problem: Identifying it, suggesting possible
solutions and implementing them. My fondest hope is that the jury&#39;s
recommendations be addressed quickly, and that we, the public, be
informed about their implementation or, when not possible, the reasons
why. A free and frank opening of the process is essential if we are to
regain trust in the justice system.
For four months I looked at the coroner&#39;s motto in
the courtroom at 50 Main Street East in Hamilton: &#39;From the death of one
we may learn to help lengthen the lives of many.&#39; That says it all.
*****
On August 9, 1991, 19-year-old Nina de Villiers
disappeared in Burlington, Ontario. Nine days later, her body was found
in a marsh near Napanee, Ont. She had been murdered, shot in the back of
the head. Two days after killing Nina, the man responsible, Jonathan Yeo,
of Caistor Centre, Ont., murdered Karen Marquis, 29, of Moncton, New
Brunswick, in a similar fashion. Not long after that, he fatally shot
himself during a police chase.
Three months before the killings, Yeo was charged in
Hamilton with sexual assault, forcible confinement and uttering death
threats after threatening a woman with a gun and knife. Soon after his
arrest, he was released on $3,000 bail with no firearm restrictions,
despite the fact that he had allegedly used a gun and a knife during the
assault.
On the evening of Nina&#39;s murder, Jonathan Yeo was
detained by U.S. immigration officials in Niagara Falls as he attempted
to cross the border into the U.S. He claimed to be heading to Florida,
even though a condition of his bail required him to be home by 10 p.m.
each evening. In his car he had live ammunition and a .22 calibre rifle,
the subsequent murder weapon of the two women. Although a U.S. customs
and immigration official notified Niagara Regional Police and the
Hamilton-Wentworth Police, neither force decided to arrest Yeo--and so
he was released.

The de Villiers Petition
CAVEAT.org
On August 9, 1991, Nina de Villiers was abducted and
murdered, while jogging in Burlington, Ontario, by Jonathan Yeo, a man
out on bail who had a long history of violence.
Nina&#39;s tragic murder led to an outpouring of emotion
from friends and strangers alike. The messages reflected the fear that
gripped the community -- the realization this could happen to anyone,
that society is not protected by the justice system. In response to
these concerns, the de Villiers family, along with some friends, decided
to launch a petition to give Canadians a means of voicing this fear.
On February 7, 1994, The de Villiers Petition, signed
by 2.5 Million Canadians, was presented to Justice Minister Allan Rock,
in Ottawa. Due to public demand, CAVEAT continues to circulate the
petition to allow concerned Canadians, who have not already done so, to
sign it.
From April to August, 1992, a Coroner&#39;s Inquest
examined Jonathan Yeo&#39;s eleven year history of attacks on women and how
he had continually slipped through cracks in the Justice and Mental
Health systems.
The inquest revealed that, prior to killing Nina de
Villiers, Yeo had been released on $3000 bail, with no weapons
restrictions, after being charged with sexual assault and using a
firearm. Yeo tried to leave the country, but was stopped at the border
by a U.S. customs officer.
The officer reported to Canadian Customs that Yeo
seemed dangerous and had a firearm, his bail release form, and a suicide
note. Canadian Customs officers felt they had no legal right to separate
Yeo from his weapon, even though he was in violation of his bail by
trying to leave the country. Yeo was allowed to return freely to Canada.
One hour later, Yeo abducted Nina in Burlington and
killed her using the same rifle he had used in the previous assault for
which he was out on bail. Next, he went on to murder Karen Marquis in
New Brunswick and then shot himself during a police pursuit in Hamilton,
Ontario.
The jury of the Yeo Inquest produced 137
recommendations aimed at preventing such a tragedy from happening again.
CAVEAT came into formal being as a voice committed to seeing that these
recommendations are acted upon.
CAVEAT wants an integrated justice system that shares
information and is accountable for the decisions. We seek justice, not
revenge. We believe that the protection of the public must be the
overriding goal of the justice system, and that the offender&#39;s rights
should not be greater than those of the victim.
National Petition
Soon after the death of their daughter Nina in
August, 1991, a national petition was launched by Priscilla and Dr.
Rocco de Villiers, with the assistance of Hamilton Mountain M.P., Beth
Phinney. The response to the petition was overwhelming, and as a result,
CAVEAT soon came into being. In just a little more than 2 years, 2.5
Million Canadians had added their names to the petition.
On February 7, 1994, the de Villiers Petition, was
presented to Justice Minister Allan Rock, in Ottawa. Priscilla and Rocco
de Villiers later met with Prime Minister Jean Chretien to discuss the
petition.
The de Villiers Petition appears as follows:

PETITION
TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
IN PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED
&#34;We, the undersigned residents of Canada, in support
of the parents of Nina de Villiers, draw the attention of the House to
the following:
&#34;THAT the murder of Nina de Villiers on the ninth of
August, 1991, has exposed serious deficiencies in the criminal justice
system. There are many vulnerable persons who have little protection
under the current system. Women, children and disabled persons are at
particular risk;
&#34;THAT crimes of violence against the person are
intolerable and constitute the most abhorrent crime society faces;
&#34;THAT current criminal law does not require bail
hearings in crimes of violence to be presided over by Judges;
&#34;THAT current criminal law may require only a simple
signature on a document, with no money actually posted, as surety for
the release of accused perpetrators of crimes of violence;
&#34;THAT sentencing in crimes of violence does not
appropriately reflect society&#39;s abhorrence of violence in order to act
as a true deterrent, and to protect the public by removal of the
offender from society;
&#34;THAT the risk to society posed by the early release
of a violent offender appears to be of secondary consideration to the
rights of the individual criminal;
&#34;THAT the statutes governing the criminal justice
system in Canada must be revised to reflect societal attitudes.
&#34;THEREFORE, your petitioners request that Parliament
recognize that crimes of violence against the person are serious and
abhorrent to society and amend the Criminal Code of Canada, the Bail
Reform Act of 1972 and the Parole Act accordingly.

The Disturbing Events That Led to the Murder of nina de Villiers and a Nationwide Campaign Against Violence
Author: Marron (Kevin)Year: 1993Publisher: Doubleday CanadaFirst EditionEdition Details: 1st Canadian Edn.Book Condition: F/FISBN: 9780385254397Price: �12.00IN STOCK NOWHardback. Jonathan Yeo was known to his wife, to the police and to the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry as a troubled and dangerous individual with an extensive history of sex-related crimes and weapon offences. Why was he free on bail to commit murder? The author&#39;s dramatic narrative poses crucial questions about justice and public safety. First he sketches the warm family life of university student Nina de Villiers, killed by Jonathan Yeo in Hamilton, Ontario in 1991. Then he shows how the anguish the de Villiers family suffered was followed by frustration and rage over an amazing catalogue of human errors compounded by shortcomings in the social and justice systems. All this emerged at a far-reaching inquest into Jonathan Yeo&#39;s death - an inquest held after much pressure from Priscilla de Villiers, Nina&#39;s mother, and a group she and her friends founded called CAVEAT (Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination). The author also vividly recounts the tragic story of Yeo, an adopted black child in a white family, whose increasingly serious record of violence, forcible confinement and rape was both unchecked and unappreciated by the authorities - partly because of a series of mistakes, partly because of victims&#39; fear of coming forward. The result was 3 preventable deaths - the murder of Nina, the subsequent murder of Karen Marquis in New Brunswick and the suicide of Jonathan Yeo. 230pp. 8vo. h/back. From the library of true crime writer, Wilfred Gregg, with his personal b/plate.  F. in f. dw.
