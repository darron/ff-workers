Tragic Endings: Roy McGregor and George Smith
© 2021, Christian CassidyRoy Ewan McGregor and George Robert Smith were thirteen-year-old boys from Winnipeg who likely never set eyes on each other. Their names are forever linked by a pair of senseless murders that took place seventy-five years ago.The McEwan family of 149 Clark Street was originally from Morris, Manitoba and moved to Winnipeg in 1942. Allister McGregor was an engine man for the CNR. Their son, Roy, was grade seven student at Earl Grey School. He was also a paper boy, air cadet, school patrol, hockey player and often
swam at the YMCA. His mother said, &#34;He was into everything .... He enjoyed every minute of living.&#34;On the night of Friday, January 4, 1946, Roy and a friend went to see a movie at a downtown cinema. After the movie, they stopped at for a milkshake at 103 Osborne Street then left the shop on foot and soon parted ways to go to their respective homes.Mrs. McGregor looks at photo of Roy.January 8, 1946, Winnipeg Tribune.When Roy didn&#39;t arrive home by 11:00 p.m. his mother called the friend&#39;s house. He told her that he did not know where Roy would have gone other than straight home. At 11:45 p.m. the McGregors called the police.Patrol cars searched the neighbourhood and officers knocked on the doors of nearby homes. One lady on Stradbrook Avenue said she heard a couple of bangs around 11:45 p.m. but couldn&#39;t see anything when she looked out the window. That was the only unusual event reported to police that night.At around 7:00 a.m. the following morning, 66-year-old Roman Kilback
showed up for work at Moore&#39;s Fuel Yard located across the street
from the McGregor home at 158 Clark Street. He turned on the overhead
lights to illuminate the bins of coal and wood for sale and discovered
the body of a small boy huddled near one of them.January 7, 1946, Winnipeg TribunePolice confirmed that the body was that of Roy McGregor and that he had been shot in the stomach and through the head. A pool of blood was found at the end of the yard nearest Stradbrook Avenue where a spur rail line and empty boxcar were located. There were signs that the body was dragged deeper into the yard to hide it amongst the bins.  Police used a war surplus mine detector to look under the snow and found the spent casing of a 9 mm bullet that they later confirmed was fired from a Canadian-made John Inglis Browning automatic pistol. That was the only substantial piece of evidence discovered at the scene.The city&#39;s entire police force was called in to work the weekend to find the shooter but there was very little to go on. Chief George Smith said it was a &#34;very unusual and ghastly crime&#34; in that it appeared to be a random attack by a single gunman. Despite the general opinion that earlier decades were more innocent times, violent murders - even those of children - were not unheard of. Some high profile child killings in the previous couple of decades included Rose Eiler in 1939, Julia Johnson in 1928, and Lola Cowan in 1927.January 8, 1946, Winnipeg TribuneOn the Tuesday after the murder, police went to five Fort Rouge schools where the boys were assembled in the auditorium and told to be wary of a strange man. It was thought that there may be a link between the murder and instances of a man who had been approaching boys in the Fort Rouge area. He asked them for a certain address, then insisted that they accompany him to that location. Police said he may be a &#34;pervert&#34; or &#34;sex maniac&#34; but didn&#39;t elaborate as to why, (or the media chose not to report the details).  The warning about the murder and the &#34;pervert&#34; was also sent to communities throughout Manitoba and Northwest Ontario as it was thought the man could have fled town to escape the manhunt.The city grieved along with the McGregor family at Roy&#39;s funeral on Thursday, January 10th. He was buried in Elmwood Cemetery. Despite a $1,000 reward for information, ($500 from the Winnipeg Police Commission and $500 from the Winnipeg Free Press as he was a paperboy for them), no tips of note came in and the story faded from the headlines. An increased police presence was noticed by some at outdoor skating rinks and other places that boys liked to hang out in the weeks following the murder. The Winnipeg Tribune&#39;s James Anderson wrote in his column that: &#34;...parents had the jitters in Winnipeg and youngsters were genuinely nervous.&#34; September 19, 1946, Winnipeg TribuneThe McGregor murder was again thrust into the headlines in September 1946 when 13-year-old George Smith of 585 Home Street was murdered.George looked young for his age - his mother said people often mistook him for being ten. He played piano and the accordion and was a caring boy who once found a pigeon with an injured wing and brought it home to nurse back to health.On the night of September 18, 1946, George attended his first boy scout meeting with the 23rd troop just a block away at what was then Home Street United Church, (now Home Street Mennonite Church). At the last minute he decided not to take his bike and set off on foot.George was last seen by friends walking home from the church around 10:00 p.m. after they parted ways at St. Mattthews Avenue and Home Street. When he did not arrive home by 11:00 p.m. the Smiths called police who sent patrol cars to the area to keep an eye out for him. The family called again at 2:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. but the boy had not been located.September 19, 1946, Winnipeg Tribune At around 7:00 that morning, a neighbour of the Smiths was driving
down the back lane of Home Street to go to work and found a boy&#39;s body
near a garage. Police confirmed that it was George Smith and discovered that he was killed by a single bullet to the back. He had been stripped of his shirt, which was found a short distance away, and it appeared as if someone tried to bind his ankles with the belt from a raincoat. There was evidence that after being shot the boy dragged himself for a few meters down the lane before collapsing. Police chief George Smith, (no relation to the victim), told the press: &#34;Everything points
to this case being the work of the same man who shot Roy McGregor&#34;. Later that day the provincial coroner said: &#34;It looks very much like one of those sexual cases like the McGregor case.&#34;The police force dropped everything to catch the now two-time murderer. Taxi cabs were booked for the day so that every available officer and detective could fan out around the West End to knock on doors and set up roadblocks. Newspapers called it the city&#39;s largest manhunt since the Gorilla Strangler back in 1927.A distraught Mrs. Smith told the Tribune, &#34;Why did it have to happen? He was so well liked ... a good
student ... and loved by all in the neighbourhood. His stamps and
chemistry set would keep him in the house most of the time. Why did it
have to happen?&#34; George Smith&#39;s funeral was September 23rd. He was buried at Brookside Cemetery.September 24, 1946, Winnipeg TribuneAs with the McGregor murder, few clues were found at the crime scene and the door knocking campaign and roadblocks yielded nothing. Winnipeg police sent information about the murders far and wide. More than 2,000 posters were put up around the Winnipeg area offering a reward of up to $7,000, ($5,000 from the city, $1,000 from the Police Commission and $1,000 from the Tribune), for information that led to an arrest. Police forces across the country were notified and the particulars were published in the February 1947 edition of the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin. Chief Smith also spoke about the murders at an International Police Chiefs conference in Mexico later that year.A couple of suspects, sex offenders from Hamilton, Ontario and London, Ontario, were questioned but both had alibis. Then a tip came in from Port Arthur, now Thunder Bay, Ontario.August 9, 1947, Winnipeg Free PressTwo men held up Palm Dairies in Port Arthur on June 30, 1947, and were arrested at the train station as they waited to return to Winnipeg. One of them, 22-year-old Michael Angelo Vescio, was found to be in possession of a Browning automatic gun and a list of what appeared to be names and addresses of Winnipeg boys.Port Arthur police chief George Taylor contacted Winnipeg police to see if Vescio might be wanted for anything in the city. At the request of the Winnipeg force, the Port Arthur police fired the gun and sent the casing to the RCMP crime lab in Regina. The spent casing from the Winnipeg murder scene was also forwarded to the lab for comparison. They were a match.Vescio was returned to Winnipeg where, according to police, he confessed to the murders while being held at the Rupert Street jail. On Saturday, August 19, 1947, he was charged with two counts of murder. (Despite the headline, there were no sex crime charges laid.)Those who knew Vescio were shocked at the news of his arrest. Vescio was a motor transport driver with the Royal Canadian Army Services Corps from 1944 until his discharge in April 1947. Former colleagues described him as friendly with a colourful imagination. He would never stay out late drinking with fellow soldiers and told them off for wolf-whistling women. Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Wright owned the Rose Street rooming house where Vescio lived while he was in the army. Mr. Wright described him as a, &#34;... shy and reserved, a man who seldom drank and never swore. Everyone liked him.&#34; The Wrights said Vescio never went out late, with he exception of catching a movie downtown, and that he preferred to stay home and read when the other soldiers living at the house went for a night on the town. He often ate supper with the elderly couple. They treated him like a son, and he called them Mum and Dad.October 8, 1947, Winnipeg Free PressIn October 1947, the preliminary hearing into both murders got underway in a packed courtroom at the central police station on Rupert Avenue. By this time, Vescio was already serving a three-year sentence for the dairy robbery.One item that came to light was the sexual nature of the crimes. It was confirmed that the state of McGregor&#39;s clothing indicated that he had been &#34;criminally assaulted&#34; prior to his murder and there was an attempt to criminally assault Smith before he was killed. Three boys testified at the hearing about being accosted by a man in the Hugo Street and McMillan Avenue area in 1945. They were very brave as, like all witnesses, they were identified by full name, age and address in the press. The stories were very similar, starting with a man asking them for help them find an address and ending in a back lane. In two of the cases a gun was produced and the boys were pulled into a secluded space where &#34;certain incidents&#34; took place. The man chillingly said to one victim: &#34;you Canadian boys are more appealing than the German boys&#34;. The man ran off after each assault.Only one of the boys, aged 12, enthusiastically identified Vescio in court. The others could only agree that he strongly resembled the man who attacked them.The testimony of the boys, the ballistics comparison of the bullet casings, and Vescio&#39;s statement of guilt made after his arrest, were enough to proceed to a full trial for the murder of George Smith the following month and for Roy McGregor at the next session of court in February 1947.Vescio entering court in October 1947 (Winnipeg Tribune)The trail began on Monday, November 17, 1947 in front of E. K. Williams, Chief Justice of the Court of King&#39;s Bench. Vescio&#39;s counsel did not dispute that he shot Smith but said his client should be charged with manslaughter, not murder. The defendant did not speak for himself, but comments made to officers after his arrest were read into testimony.Vescio claimed that he went on a long walk on the night of the murder and bought a bottle of alcohol that he drank in Vimy Memorial Park until he felt sick and dizzy. He was going to stop at a store at Home and Arlington to call for someone to pick him up but the store was packed and he instead continued walking down Home Street. When Vescio saw Smith, he claimed he asked the boy if he could use the phone at his house. The boy said something to the effect that his father would not allow a drunk in the house. This angered Vescio who grabbed the boy and they struggled. When Vescio slipped on some clay, Smith tried to break free and that is when his shirt got ripped off.Vescio then claimed that he fell to the ground which caused the gun in his coat to fire and it hit Smith in the back. His fear and cowardice led him to flee rather than call for help. There was no explanation as to why the boy&#39;s ankles were partially bound.November 25, 1947, Winnipeg TribuneThe case was given to the jury on the morning of November 24, 1947, and just 35 minutes later it returned with a guilty verdict. Justice Williams sentenced Vescio to hang. When asked if he had anything to say, Vescio rose and said he didn&#39;t.The Vescio family, a brother and two sisters from Port Arthur, tried every avenue of appeal open to them. The final step came on October 8, 1948, when it was heard by the Supreme Court of Canada. On November 2nd, it dismissed his appeal for a new trial and it was certain that Vescio would hang.Vescio&#39;s death sentence meant that the McGregor family would never get their day in court. The murder charge related to Roy McGregor was eventually dropped from the court&#39;s schedule.At 1:02 a.m. on Friday, November 19, 1948, Michael Angleo Vescio, now 24, was hanged at Headingley Jail. He was pronounced dead 15 minutes later. Media reports said that Vescio was calm on the gallows and had no final words to say.It was rumoured that in his final days Vescio confessed to both murders and gave details of the deaths. This was confirmed in a 1950 annual report of the provincial jail system.More from the Tragic Endings series.

BRITAIN&#39;S COAL OUTPUT BRIGHT LONDON, Aug. 9 One &#39;piece of ongnt news almost escaped stten tion here today in the midst ot Britain&#39;s preoccupation with the looming crisis: it was that the coal stocks at &#39;the nation&#39;s great electricity generating stations are now sufficient to forestall any repe tition ox last years disastrous fuel crisis.Coal stocks as a whole at the end of June, latest for which of ficial figures are available, stood at more than 10,500,000 tons, or 2,500,000 tons better than a year previously, and It is in the risht places at locations where it be actually burnt, instead of lying near mines and thus in danger of being immobilised If last winter&#39;s bad weather were repeated.

TITO JAILS 50 CANADIANS, EDITOR SAYS Letter Describes Slav Maltreatment The Yugoslavian govern ment has imprisoned &#34;at least 50&#34; of a group of Canadian Yugoslavs, recently returned to Europe, on charges of sabotage or because they were unwilling to carry out the orders of the Yugoslav authorities.Peter Stankovlc, editor of the Winnipeg weekly Croatian Voice, claimed Frld.v which appeared in the latest edi tion oi tne Croatian voice. Many were Jailed en voicing complaints of thia treatment, even though agents of Marshall The had given permission for the troup to bring equipment with them. Many of the younger men were transferred to collective farms under state control, away from the homes of their relatives, while others were forced to engage in railway construction work In Bosnia, the story continued. &#39;cause I vruu these thlaet 1 receive threats on my safety and even on my life,&#34; the editor declared, &#34;but I shall continue. I hope 10 prim more oi my paper in English in the future Mr.Stankovlc said he expected to ootain later the names of the former Canadian Yugoslavs im prisoned. Other letters received by Mr. ttankevle addressed to Canadian Yugoslavs read, In part: &#34;You should thank Cod you are In the holy land where you are, while we have no feed or clothing.&#34; This letter further reported that no flour had been allotted to the household since Easter other than a few grains of corn flour. When the child cries for food, I am forced to beat him and tell him to go to sleep,&#34; the letter continued. &#34;Two years after the war we were not badly off through the help of U.N.N.R.A., but now there is nothing but bread, and very little of that.&#34; Food was given to Romania be fore the elections last fall to get more communist votes, M.Stankovlc explained. Albania also received an allotment for this reason, no said. &#34;Finally In February of 1M7 they found that there was not enough grain, after telling U.N.N. R. they would be alright till the next harvest,&#34; he eon tinued.&#34;Government police forced grain i from the neaxantJi again and again. The government even now has its police stand by as peasants are harvesting their crops and take the majority of grain for government use before the farmers can save any for themselves.

R.C.M.P. ballistics experts at Regina determined what Discovery of a gun after a holdup in Port Arthur led to the murder charges in connection with the deaths of two Winnipeg boys. CLUE STARTS St ARCH Police Mine Detector Found Vital Bullet in Sex By VICTOR V. MURRAY How a mine detector was turned into a crime detector was first revealed today by Chief Constable Charles Mac Iver.No need at this point to go into details of how two Winnipeg boys were slain by a sex pervert in January, and September of 1946. All that police had to work on was mute evidence of resistance against improper advances and then death. They also had descriptions of the suspect. Descriptions that would fit any one of a thousand men. First thing police looked for when the first murder occurred CHIEF CONSTABLE $7,000 Offered To Catch Killer A total of $7,000 in reward money still stands for the arrest and conviction of the murderer of Roy Ewan McGregor and George Robert Smith.The sum of $1,000 was&#34; offered for the apprehension lending to the conviction of the slayer of the McGregor boy with rewards of $500 each by the City ot Winnipeg and the Manitoba Free Pre. A total of $6,000 more wai offered In the murder of 13 year old George Smith. The eityxouneil offered the Board ef Commissioners ef Police, $1,000. All the rewards are toed until fee. 1.IMS. SATURDAY, AUGUST 9, mm i I in 1 1., shown above probing: Moore&#39;s FOX GUN was the murder weapon. But the murderer had not left his calling card. Next thing to establish was what kind of weapon was used. Bullet wounds didn need any explaining, beyond the most important What kind ot bullets? Once they had established the type of bullets they could tell what particular make ot weapon was used.There were no bullets In the body ot Koy MoUresor when it was found, in one of the coal bins ot a fuel yard, on Jan. 5, 1946. Chief Constable Maclver, then deputy chief, was in charge of on the spot investigation, with ex Chief Constable George Smith directing over all activities. TO DECIDE REWARD The Winnipeg Tribune on Sept. 20, 1946.offered a $1,000 reward to stand for six months, expiring March 20 of this year. The chief constable ot the Cit ot Winnipeg Is the sole arbiter as to who shall receive the reward, pi how It may be divided. In the event that there should be more tlwm one claimant. Employees ot the city police department are barred from accepting rewards that are posted for crimes committed la Manitoba. 1947 coal vard.Clarke with armv kind of gun had fired the bullet. Slaying A mine detector was borrowed from military authorities in an effort to find either the weapon, or one of the expended bullets. None of the policemen were mine detector experts, but a few of the recruits had seen them used In the war. With the military strictly out of the picture, as far as crime detection was concerned, the police went to work and trained their own bullet detector squad. First of all they strewed nails and bottle tops over the ground, and found out how such material registered in the mine detector&#39;s ear phones.Then they planted a few bullets and noticed the difference in sound reaction. It was three days latvr, working with three squads, that they got the first &#34;ping&#34; that meant they were close to what they were seeking. Two spent cartridges, one live cartridge, and one bullet a smashed bullet were recovered. Lots of people have fancy Ideas of how fictional detectives work. Maybe they would like to know how detectives operate when they&#39;re trying to crack a rase.Here&#39;s what happened. The car tridges, and the bullet that had gone through the murdered boy&#39;s body, were sent to the R.C.M.P. crime laboratory at Regina. There they were tested by Sgt. A.Mason Ftisch, ballistics expert, who stated that the weapon used had been a 9 millimetre Brown ing automatic pistol, manufactured by a firm In Veto. City police Immediately sent a confidential letter to police depart ments all over Canada, the united States, and Mexico, asking that a look out be kept for any criminals found In possession of such a weapon. tCentmued en age Ne. 1) 1 42 PAGES lakehead Man Held A double murder charo slaying of two 13 year old Winnipeg boys, Soy McGregor and George Smith killings which terrorized 1 wre cuv January ana septemDer, mo.

Thomas Young (1931 – June 30, 1959) was a Canadian mass murderer and rapist who killed five people, including his father and a police officer, in Ear Falls, Ontario on early Christmas Day in 1958. Young was convicted of murder for killing the police officer, Calvin Fulford, whom he shot with the officer&#39;s  own service revolver, and sentenced to death. He was executed in 1959.
Early life[edit]
Thomas Young had two brothers, one of whom was named John.[1] He was a former Ontario Hydro worker.[2]
Murders, trial, and execution[edit]
On late December 24, 1958, Thomas got into an argument at a Christmas party. When John Young intervened, Thomas slapped his brother in the face and said he was going home.[2]
On December 25, 1958, a drunken Thomas was at the cabin of his father, 47-year-old Albert Young, when a young couple, Walter &#34;Jimmy&#34; Gordon, 18, and Clara Gordon, 16, arrived with John to play phonograph records. John opened the kitchen door to find Thomas standing here holding a rifle. He yelled at the others to run before Thomas opened fire. Albert and the Gordons were killed. Thomas also tried to kill John and another teen who was present, 16-year-old David Williams, but both of them managed to escape.[1][2][3]
The two went to the house of David&#39;s father, 47-year-old George Williams, and told him what had happened. John and George then went to the house of constable Calvin Russell Fulford, 28, for help. Fulford had been preparing for Christmas with his wife and their three children, ages 21 months to 9 years, and the family had just opened presents.[4]
After being told about Thomas, Fulford got his service revolver and approached the Young cabin with John and George. When the three were about 60 feet away from the cabin, Thomas opened fire on them. Williams tried to charge him, but was fatally shot. Fulford was shot in the shoulder and tried to crawl back to his car. He managed to crawl about 20 yards before losing consciousness. Thomas then approached Fulford, took his revolver, jammed it into his mouth, and shot him. John managed to escape unharmed.[1][5]
John ran back to Fulford&#39;s house and told the officer&#39;s wife what had happened. She called the police, and the two officers who responded found Fulford&#39;s body. They radioed for help and additional officers arrived. They entered the cabin, where they found the bodies. Thomas started firing at the officers from his grandparents&#39; nearby shack. The officers crawled near it and flushed him out by firing two tear gas bombs inside. Thomas subsequently surrendered, and was found with a rifle and Fulford&#39;s revolver. He did not give a reason for the murders.[6]
Thomas was only charged with Fulford&#39;s murder. During the investigation, police did not state an official motive, but said there was strong evidence that Clara Gordon had been raped. She had fled the house, but was dragged inside by Thomas. Her body was found on a couch. Neighbors said Thomas had been upset when Clara, who he had known for years, married Gordon. They described him as moody and unpredictable.[6][7] It was later found that Clara had been pregnant. The couple had only been married for about two weeks.[8][9]
During his murder trial in March 1959, multiple witnesses said Thomas was the shooter.[10] Thomas was the only witness to take the stand in his defense. He said he was drinking heavily that night and could not remember what had happened. Thomas claimed his last memory was leaving a party at a neighbor&#39;s home and heading home, and that he &#34;came to&#34; while walking on a nearby highway, and realized he was carrying a rifle and a revolver. He then said he came across the bodies, got scared, and ran to his grandparents&#39; home.[1]
The trial lasted four days. On March 21, after deliberating for three hours, the jury found Thomas guilty of murder. He received a mandatory death sentence without a recommendation for mercy, and had an execution date set for June 30, 1959. Thomas did not react as the verdict and sentence were read.[1]
After Thomas&#39;s appeals failed, and the federal cabinet denied his bid for reprieve, he was executed as scheduled at the Kenora District Jail. A sheriff said Thomas was &#34;exceptionally calm&#34; as he walked to the gallows and had no last words. He was pronounced dead at 2:20 AM.[11]
A bridge was named in Fulford&#39;s honor in 2011.[12]
