The Northern B.C. murderers used the exact type of rifles Trudeau is hoping to ban
The RCMP has now released their report on the Northern B.C. murder investigation involving two men from Port Alberni. Anyone interested in how the police conducted their investigation should read it. Heck, every Canadian adult should read it.

The RCMP has now released their report on the Northern B.C. murder investigation involving two men from Port Alberni. Anyone interested in how the police conducted their investigation should read it.
Heck, every Canadian adult should read it. While it describes a disturbing series of events that hit close to home it&#39;s sensitive to the three victims&#39; families and mostly details how the investigation went down. It offers a look at how robust this particular operation was.

On Friday we published a piece about how the RCMP had confessions but no motive from the killers, Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky.
In the conclusion of the report it&#39;s stated that &#34;Based on the firearms lab results, similar offence pattern, timelines of suspects and admissions from McLeod and Schmegelsky, no other suspects are responsible for the three homicides.&#34;
Those firearms mentioned were two models of the same type of weapon; the SKS. One (the black one pictured below) was confirmed to be legally purchased from a Cabela&#39;s store in Nanaimo on the day the pair embarked on their ill-fated trip.
One box of 20 rounds of ammunition for it was also purchased that day, using Kam McLeod’s Possession and Acquisition License.
The second rifle was an older model SKS (the wood stock one on the bottom of this photo below).
Both are widely available in Canada and other countries.

Designed in 1943 in the Soviet Union, the SKS is common among legal firearm owners in Canada and there are literally millions of them in circulation worldwide.
They&#39;re available at most stores that sell guns in this country, and according to Calibre.ca they&#39;re &#34;about the cheapest semi-automatic centre-fire firearm on the Canadian market&#34;.
You can buy one (if you have a valid PAL certification from the RCMP) for $250.
In Canada the legal magazine capacity is 5 rounds, meaning you can pop off 5 shots quickly. Then you have to take the magazine off and put on another one.
That&#39;s the same capacity as regular ol&#39; hunting rifles that come as semi-automatics but - again - there is one major difference; these &#34;military-style&#34; ones look scarier.
I shot one of these rifles at a range in December of 2016. It was fun - much like the joy that comes from quick-succession swings at a batting cage - but I wouldn&#39;t ever want to own one.
As you&#39;ll see in the video below I hit 5 out of 5 targets. You&#39;d have to be a pretty terrible shot to require 5 shots at any game you&#39;re hunting in Canada, but I appreciate why people would want to have one of these to practice target shooting.
I once shot the same model of firearm (the SKS) that Kam Mcleod and Bryer Schmegelsky used to murder three people in B.C..

However I don&#39;t personally think that banning rifles currently available in Canada is going to make us any more safe.
As I said in my column last week, every semi-automatic weapon in this country is just as dangerous as the &#34;military-style&#34; ones that the Trudeau government is looking to ban. And very rarely have they been used in mass shootings.
Undeterred by that fact, this week the Liberal party seems to have ramped up their election-time rhetoric around banning &#34;military-style&#34; weapons in Canada.
They just want to ban the scary looking ones.
It would seem to me that the people who are most scared are the Liberals, not wanting to go whole hog and ban semi-automatic guns completely.
That&#39;d involve a real political risk on their part, and it seems to be one they&#39;re not willing to take.

A British man, 36, has admitted murdering his Canadian ex-girlfriend with a hammer and gunshot but denied killing her 22-month-old daughter. Robert Leeming&#39;s guilty plea comes two years after he led undercover cops to a shallow grave with the bodies of Jasmine Lovett, 25, and her daughter Aliyah Sanderson in Kananaskis, near where he lived in Calgary. He pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Lovett and not guilty to the second-degree murder of Aliyah at the beginning of his trial. HGV mechanic Leeming, of Wiltshire, told the Calgary court he flew into a rage with his lodger and former lover Lovett and attacked her with a hammer before shooting her in the head when she accused him of injuring her daughter. He denied killing Aliyah, describing her as a &#39;great kid&#39;, and claimed she died from injuries sustained when she fell down stairs.After the pair disappeared in April, Leeming claimed he &#39;did nothing wrong&#39; and that he was on a date with another woman when Lovett and Sanderson went missing.  But he later led two undercover police officers, who had befriended him offering to help remove the bodies, to the grave in Grizzly Creek, leading to his arrest.        Robert Leeming, 36, has admitted murdering his Canadian ex-girlfriend with a hammer and gunshot but denied killing her 22-month-old daughter        Leeming&#39;s guilty plea comes two years after the bodies of Jasmine Lovett, 25, (pictured) and her daughter Aliyah Sanderson were found in a shallow grave in Kananaskis, near CalgaryLeeming was the only witness to testify for the defence. The court heard the 36-year-old &#39;just snapped&#39; at Lovett and bludgeoned her with a hammer before shooting her in the head with a 0.22 calibre rifle as she lay bleeding heavily on the floor. He said he was &#39;happy&#39; to look after Aliyah during his on-and-off relationship with her mother and that he and Lovett were &#39;friends&#39;.  The court heard Lovett had skull fractures and had been shot in the head while Aliyah died of blunt force trauma to the head.  On the first day of his trial at the Court of Queen&#39;s Justice last month, Leeming&#39;s defense lawyer Balfour Der said there was no evidence the 36-year-old had killed Aliyah.  Der added a medical examiner had testified it was possible she died from injuries sustained in a fall. He said: &#39;The absence of evidence will support reasonable doubt. The verdict should be not guilty but, I say, as an alternative, there may be a finding of manslaughter.&#39;  Prosecutor Doug Taylor pushed back on Der&#39;s statement, arguing Leeming had never told police the child&#39;s death was an accident.&#39;No one would pass up that opportunity unless it was not an accident,&#39; he said. Taylor also told the court Leeming&#39;s story of a fall did not fit with forensic evidence and &#39;defies logic&#39; and pointed out that he had lied repeatedly. &#39;He told lie after lie after he murdered Jasmine and, so says the Crown, Aliyah. He lied to the police. He lied to the public. He lied to his ex-wife. He lied to his employer. &#39;All of this was a calculated scheme to get away with murder - and not just one, but two.&#39; Taylor also told the court it &#39;does not have to be able to find with certainty the exact mechanisms of how it is that the accused would have committed the murder against Aliyah Sanderson, just so long as he is found to be legally responsible for it&#39;.         Leeming told police he flew into a rage and attacked Lovett when she questioned him about whether he had caused injuries to Aliyah (pictured) who fell down the stairs while he was looking after herAliyah&#39;s grandmother Jodi Sanderson attended court and told reporters it was &#39;hard to watch&#39; and that she was eager for the case to come to an end.   &#39;You know what happened, but to hear it explained in detail was pretty traumatic. I&#39;m glad we&#39;re finally coming to a close and it&#39;ll be all over soon,&#39; she said, adding that she wanted to see Leeming convicted.  &#39;That would be the biggest relief. He&#39;s already admitted to Jasmine. That&#39;s another thing that really rocks me to the core. To not admit to Aliyah, at least… some wrongdoing, is very hard to listen to.&#39; Speaking outside court during the trial last month, Lovett&#39;s mother Kim Blankert said: &#39;It&#39;s kind of like getting hit by a truck every day that we come in here, but we still come and stand up for Jasmine and Aliyah.&#39;It doesn&#39;t matter to me what happens to Robert Leeming because it doesn&#39;t change anything, it doesn&#39;t bring the girls back. Obviously, we want justice, but it doesn&#39;t matter in the long run, as far as the healing goes.&#39;The healing comes from after this is all over, and we can just move forward and away from all of the violence.&#39;   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 2 Next       Children in NASA space video with Kamala Harris are ACTORS:...

Lovett and Aliyah were reported missing on April 16 after they failed to show up for a family dinner. Leeming was initially arrested in connection with the disappearance but later released. He was re-arrested after police found the bodies - doused in gasoline, wrapped in blue blankets, and covered in dirt and branches - in a shallow grave in Kananaskis, 70 miles west of the home where Lovett and Leeming lived.  In a statement at the time, police said: &#39;At approximately 4am on Monday, May 6, 2019, we located the bodies of a woman and child, believed to be that of Jasmine Lovett and Aliyah Sanderson, in Kananaskis.   &#39;The investigation led officers to a heavily wooded area near Grizzly Creek located off Highway 40, where the bodies were discovered.&#39;A suspect has been taken into custody and charges are pending.&#39; Police had been searching for the bodies in the Bragg Creek area which is located 40 miles closer to where Leeming said he last saw the pair at his house.But after making a breakthrough they moved their search near Grizzly Creek where the pair were found on May 6, 2019.         Leeming led two undercover police officers to the shalow grave in Grizzly Creek after they told him they had retrieved a bag of evidence from a nosy neighbourLeeming led two undercover police officers to the site after they told him they had retrieved a bag of evidence from a nosy neighbour and offered to help with his troubles by removing the bodies, the Global Times reported. The officers were led to the site on foot by Leeming, who knew exactly where to take them, according to their testimony. &#39;I said, &#34;OK, where to?&#34; And [Leeming] goes, &#34;You&#39;re looking at it.&#34; And he points down. And underneath and against my left foot were branches and a pile,&#39;[Leeming] goes and he grabs a branch and lifts it up as if to prove what&#39;s underneath all these branches. As he does that, I see a small bit of blue that I believe to be the moving blankets.&#39;  The find came days after Leeming boasted to reporters outside a bar while a forensics team searched his house: &#39;They will find nothing because I did nothing wrong.&#39;The undercover officers also told the court Leeming had gloated about hiding raw bacon around his house and filling his car with mulch in an effort to throw police off his trail. In a recording played during his trial, Leeming could be heard telling cops he filled the trunk of his car with mulch because &#39;it smells like death&#39;. Asked if he had cleaned up the car properly after transporting the bodies, he said &#39;oh, yeah&#39;.Leeming was also heard telling undercover officers he was pleased his car - a 2014 Mercedes - was an older model so police would not be able to use a computer in the vehicle to work out where he had been.     Lovett and Sanderson were lodging with Leeming before their deaths. He had been in an intimate relationship with Lovett, who had lived with him for the previous seven months.Leeming, who was born on a British Army base in Germany and later lived in Wiltshire, told police he went for a picnic with the pair on April 17. He said he then went out on a date with a woman who he had been seeing for a few months.  Lovett&#39;s bank card was used for an online purchase the following day.The court will set a date for a verdict on December 3.        Lovett and Sanderson (pictured) were lodging with Leeming before their deaths. He had been in an intimate relationship with Lovett, who had lived with him for the previous seven months

Calgary man found guilty of second-degree murder in death of former girlfriend&#39;s daughter

Calgary man found guilty of second-degree murder in death of former girlfriend&#39;s daughter
A Calgary man who admitted to murdering his former girlfriend but denied killing her daughter has been found guilty of killing the young girl.
Robert Leeming, 37, pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial to the second-degree murder of Jasmine Lovett in 2019 but not guilty in the death of 22-month-old Aliyah Sanderson.
Leeming was convicted of second-degree murder Monday in connection with the death of the little girl.
His lawyer said during closing arguments in November that there&#39;s no evidence to prove Leeming was responsible for the girl&#39;s death.
Leeming testified he was looking after Aliyah when she fell down some stairs, then he found her limp and unresponsive when he checked on her later.
He said he snapped when Lovett accused him of doing something to her child and struck her several times with a hammer before coming back with a rifle and shooting her in the head.
The bodies of the mother and child were found buried in a shallow grave in Kananaskis Country, west of Calgary, in May 2019 after they went missing weeks earlier.
While reading his 54 page verdict, Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Keith Yamauchi said Leeming continuously lied throughout his testimony.
“Mr. Leeming is not a believable witness,” said Yamauchi.
In his decision, Yamauchi said the testimony of medical examiner that indicated a fall ‘could not do that to Aliyah’ weighed heavily on his guilty verdict.
The judge found that Leeming had committed an unlawful act of assault on Sanderson that resulted in her death.
He says beyond a reasonable doubt, Leeming &#34;intended the natural consequences of his actions,&#34; knowing the injuries Sanderson sustained would result in her death.
&#34;Mr. Leeming made a decision as to how he would conduct himself,&#34; said Crown prosecutor Douglas Taylor following the announcement of the verdict.. &#34;I would agree with you he told quite a few lies.&#34;
GUT WRENCHING
It was a gut-wrenching experience for the family as they waited for Monday&#39;s verdict.
Jodi Sanderson, Aliyah&#39;s grandmother, wept in the courtroom as the judge convicted Leeming in the death of her 22-month old granddaughter.
Leeming sat in a grey sweater in court on Monday morning with his head down, showing little emotion.
&#34;His actions and demeanour were nothing but disturbing,&#34; said Sanderson.
&#34;At one point, they thought he was falling asleep, so we stopped for a little bit to wake him up which was extremely weird,&#34; added Lovett’s mother, Kim Blankert.
For the victims&#39; family, today marks the beginning of a healing journey.
&#34;I actually wanted to get up and hug the judge but I know that would have looked super weird,&#34; said Blankert. &#34;We’re pleased that we got justice and relieved that is over.&#34;
A sentencing date has not been confirmed. A second-degree murder conviction carries a life sentence but the duration of Leeming&#39;s parole exclusion will be determined.
Douglas said the Crown had not yet determined what sentence it would request.
&#34;We&#39;re going to process the reasons for decision, have a look at the facts and we&#39;ll craft our sentencing position based on that,&#34; he said.
&#34;I would say it&#39;s safe to say we&#39;ll be asking for something in excess of 10 years,&#34; added Taylor.
A court date to schedule a sentencing date is set to take place February 11, 2022.
A second-degree murder conviction carries a life sentence but the duration of Leeming&#39;s parole exclusion will be determined.
DEFENCE &#39;DISAPPOINTED&#39;
Leeming’s lawyer said during closing arguments in November that there&#39;s no evidence to prove Leeming was responsible for the girl&#39;s death.
Balfour Der says he and Leeming are both ‘disappointed’ by the verdict.
“We ran a defence and believed that the man had a legitimate defence and that they hadn’t proved his guilt in relation to Aliyah,” said Der to CTV News.
“Credibility is a big part of this case. If he is not believed then that takes away the part of the defence that he spoke to.&#34;
Der said the defence is looking at all options.
“We have some things in mind in what we would like to do,” said Der.
“Whether there is an appeal from this or not, time will tell (once) we digest the decision to see if there is anything that lends itself to an appeal.”
