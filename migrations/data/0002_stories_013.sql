Jonathan Yeo, prime suspect in the murder of two women and the gunpoint rape of another, was refused entry to the United States at Niagara Falls, but on his return to Canada he cleared immigration even though he had a rifle and a suicide note in his car.Two hours after Yeo, 32, re-entered Canada, Nina de Villiers, 19, disappeared while jogging near her Burlington, Ont., tennis club.Yeo, who is dead of a self-inflicted gunshot, is the key suspect in her death.The woman&#39;s body was found Friday in a creek by Highway 401, near Kingston. She had been shot once in the back of the head with a .22-caliber rifle.Two days after Ms. de Villiers&#39; Aug. 9 disappearance, Karen Marquis, 29, was found shot to death in her Moncton, New Brunswick, home.

On the day he had attempted to cross the border, Yeo appeared in a Hamilton court on charges that he had raped a 31-year-old Hamilton woman at gunpoint last April.
Jack Bulger, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in Buffalo, said Yeo was turned away at the border because he was awaiting trial and because he had a rifle.&#34;Although neither of those in and of themselves are necessarily grounds for exclusion,&#34; he said, &#34;the entire picture would lead one to suspect that he was trying to avoid the jurisdiction of the court.&#34;Milton Best, communications manager for the Ontario region of the Canadian Immigration Department, said that even though Canadian immigration officials were notified about Yeo, it made no difference as to Yeo&#39;s ability to return to Canada.
&#34;There was no warrant for his arrest in this country,&#34; he said. Yeo, he added, had an &#34;absolute right&#34; to re-enter Canada even &#34;if he has an arsenal of guns.&#34;
Last week, Yeo, an unemployed Hamilton steel worker and father of four, fatally shot himself after a police chase in Hamilton.

The Concordia University massacre was a school shooting on August 24, 1992 in which Valery I. Fabrikant, an associate professor of mechanical engineering, killed four colleagues and wounded a staff member at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Overview[edit]
Perpetrator[edit]
Fabrikant was a mechanical engineering associate professor who had worked at Concordia University for 13 years. He had begun as a technician, and long demonstrated disruptive behaviour against students, staff members and other academics, described as ranging from &#34;undesirable to intolerable&#34;, with which the university had struggled to deal. One student claimed in a 1982 filed police report that he had raped her and dislocated her shoulder.[1] In addition, he had presented academic challenges in teaching and supervision. As early as 1989, two people reported him saying, &#34;I know how people get what they want, they shoot a lot of people.&#34;[2]
Relations between Fabrikant and the University became increasingly strained in late 1991 and the spring of 1992. Colleagues became alarmed after he turned his aggression against them. After being denied tenure, Fabrikant charged members of the engineering department with questionable financial dealings and improper credit for research work. Because of his unacceptable behaviour in addition to the charges, he faced dismissal on grounds of intimidation and harassment of fellow staff members. He was also under a contempt of court charge for behavior in a lawsuit against colleagues regarding credit on professional articles.
Incident[edit]
On August 24, Fabrikant entered the Engineering department at Concordia with three guns and ammunition in his briefcase. In his shooting rampage on the ninth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building, he killed Electrical and Computer Engineering Departmental Chair Phoivos Ziogas and professors Matthew Douglass, Michael Hogben, and Aaron Jaan Saber (known as Jaan Saber). Fabrikant wounded Elizabeth Horwood, a departmental staff secretary.[3] None of the victims were personally involved in the controversy which Fabrikant had started.
Fabrikant was charged with murder and assault, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He was denied parole in 2015 and again in 2022.[4]
Events[edit]
Around 2:30 p.m. on Monday, August 24, 1992, Fabrikant walked onto the ninth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building. He was carrying a briefcase that contained three handguns (a snub-nosed Smith &amp; Wesson .38-calibre 5-shot revolver, a German-made 6.35mm Meb pistol with a 6-round magazine, and an Argentinian-made 7.65mm Bersa pistol with an 8-round magazine) and a large amount of ammunition.
First he went looking for Dean of Engineering and Computer Science Srikanta Swamy and M.O.M (Sam) Osman (the chair of the mechanical engineering department). Neither were present. Next, he headed to his own office where he was scheduled to meet Michael Hogben, the president of the Concordia University Faculty Association (CUFA). According to police, Hogben attempted to give Fabrikant a letter setting out the conditions under which he would be allowed to visit the CUFA offices. The letter noted Fabrikant&#39;s access would be restricted because his behaviour was causing those who worked there &#34;considerable distress&#34;. Fabrikant took out his .38 calibre pistol and shot Hogben three times. Hogben fell to the floor and died shortly thereafter.
A faculty colleague, Aaron Jaan Saber, called out from his office nearby. Fabrikant crossed the hall and fired two shots into Saber, who died in the hospital the next day. Back in the hall, heading back to Osman&#39;s office again, he fired at Elizabeth Horwood, wounding her in the thigh. Fabrikant worked his way through the ninth floor corridors to the other side of the building and into the office of Phoivos Ziogas (chair of the electrical and computer-engineering department), who was talking with colleague Otto Schwelb. Fabrikant shot Ziogas twice; he died in hospital a month later. He scuffled with Schwelb, who took control of the pistol. Unaware that Fabrikant had two other guns in his briefcase, Schwelb went back to tend the injured Ziogas.
Urgences-santé force led by Paramedic Assistant Chief Anthony DiMonte coordinated with Police with new protocols learnt from the 1989 University of Montreal shooting.
Matthew Douglass (a professor of civil engineering known to be close to Dean Swamy), tried to reason with Fabrikant when he arrived at the dean&#39;s office. Fabrikant shot him four times, and Douglass died almost instantly.[1]
Fabrikant took a security guard and another professor (George Abdou) hostage, locked himself in an office, and called an emergency operator. He said he had just committed several murders and wanted to talk to a TV reporter. He stayed on the line for an hour. When he briefly put his gun down to adjust the phone, Abdou kicked it away and the security guard overpowered him.[5]
Aftermath[edit]
The university commissioned two Independent Committees of Inquiry to investigate aspects of the August events. In addition, it established task forces to work on internal policy and procedures. In April 1994, the Independent Committee of Inquiry into Academic and Scientific Integrity, headed by H. W. Arthurs, former president of York University, presented their report, entitled Integrity in Scholarship (informally known as the Arthurs Report). It noted issues at Concordia and other production-driven research institutions. It stated: &#34;We have confirmed the validity of a number of Dr. Fabrikant&#39;s more specific allegations&#34; about financial mismanagement and questions about scholarship practices such as article attribution. The report noted that Fabrikant&#39;s allegations were not motivated by concern for the public good, however. Instead, they were the &#34;ultimate revenge&#34; of a desperate man who had already tried blackmail and threats against officials.[6]
An independent review was conducted by John Scott Cowan, former faculty association president and former vice-president (administration) of the University of Ottawa, who was commissioned to study Fabrikant&#39;s employment history and related human-resource issues at Concordia University. He documented years of behavioural problems by Fabrikant. In addition, he identified problems common to university environments, where disruptive behaviour has sometimes been excused under the mantle of academic freedom and because many of the academics involved had little experience as managers. He noted that often academic administrators were not comfortable as managers and needed additional training as reported in May 1994 on Lessons from the Fabrikant File (also known as the Cowan Report). His report included recommendations for how the university could improve its internal communication and management of academics and departments.[2]
In their investigation of academic credentials, a journalist team from the Montreal Gazette discovered that Fabrikant was not a political dissident as he had claimed. Instead, he had emigrated from the USSR after having been fired from a succession of posts for his threatening and disruptive behaviour.
As a result, Concordia University made a number of changes to its ethics rules and administrative procedures to improve operations, the integrity of scholarship, and management of faculty and staff. In addition, it established conflict-resolution workshops and resources. The university fired Fabrikant 17 days after the rampage.[1]
Fabrikant is serving his sentence at Archambault Prison in Sainte-Anne-Des-Plaines, Quebec. He was denied parole in 2015 and again in 2022.[7]
Legal proceedings[edit]
During his trial, Fabrikant came across as petty, vindictive, unrepentant and vain along with being rude and hostile to the judges, whom he called a &#34;low little crook&#34; and even had the same attitude aimed at the psychiatrists who testified on whether he was sane enough for the proceedings to continue.[3]
During the trial Fabrikant acted as his own lawyer (after firing ten lawyers in the process) and called 75 witnesses for his defense, but in the end it took the jury only seven hours to find him guilty of four charges of first degree murder, attempted murder, and two hostage charges.[8] This legal decision has not stopped him from seeking legal challenges to the court&#39;s decision. In 2011 a Superior Court judge dismissed a suit by Fabrikant against his colleagues that had been filed in 1992.[8] He has filed so many lawsuits while behind bars that Canadian courts have declared him a &#34;vexatious litigant&#34; and his computer access while in prison is limited.[1]
Legacy[edit]
Four large granite study tables were placed in the foyer of the Hall Building as a memorial to the slain professors. A nearby wall plaque commemorates the event.
Concordia&#39;s Board of Governors had earlier adopted a policy banning firearms on the university campus. After Fabrikant&#39;s murders, the university joined the Coalition for Gun Control and gathered signatures for a petition calling for tougher national gun laws. In March 1994 Concordia representatives presented members of Parliament with a 200,000-signature petition to ban the private ownership of handguns in Canada.[9]
In addition, the university adopted new rules governing financial accountability and scientific integrity, improvements in process at the time of the August 1992 events. The Internal Audit function was also restructured.[10]
In 1995 the university adopted &#34;The Code of Rights &amp; Responsibilities&#34; and named an Advisor on the Code. It set out standards of conduct for all members of the University. Further work was done on a new code of ethics, resulting in a partial version of &#34;The Code of Ethics: Guidelines for Ethical Actions&#34; being adopted in 1995. The full version was adopted in 1997.[9]
The university created initiatives related to civil behaviour and conflict resolution, including the Peace and Conflict Resolution Series that began in 2003.[9]
Morris Wolfe&#39;s 2002 article on the events won a Canadian Association of Journalists Award for Investigative Journalism.[5]

Derek Anthony Wood and the Sydney River McDonald’s Murders
Published May 6, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.
Human depravity and greed are a dangerous combination. When combined with drug abuse, a knife and a .22 calibre pistol they are lethal, as this case proves.
On May 7, 1992, three young men robbed a Sydney River, Nova Scotia, McDonald’s restaurant in the belief they would make off with $80,000.
Instead they found only $2,000 and murdered three innocent people: Jimmy Fagan, 27, Donna Warren, 22, and Neil Burroughs Jr., 29. They left Arlene MacNeil, 20, for dead. She survived but was permanently disabled.
The ringleader of this trio of deadly morons was then-18-year-old Derek Anthony Wood but he wasn’t the brightest bulb in the pack.
Wood propped open a basement door to the restaurant with his backpack so the three could enter after the restaurant closed. He forgot to take the backpack with him after he and his fellow murderers killed three and disabled another. His stupidity made it easy for police to identify him and track him down.
He also attempted to claim he was outside having a smoke when he heard gun shots. Locked outside, he called police, he said, to report the crimes in progress. His attempted ruse held up for all of 8 seconds.
All three young men claimed repeatedly they never intended to kill anyone that night. The execution-style shootings of all four victims suggests they were less than truthful, to be polite.
The Murders
At about 1 a.m., May 7, 1992 taxi drivers discovered a bloody and tragic scene at McDonald’s Restaurant, Sydney River.
James Fagan, a night cleaner, was found lying face down in a pool of blood at the back door. He was shot in the head at close range only moments after arriving by taxi early for work. He died later that day in hospital.
Police and ambulances arrived a short time later and discovered three other victims.
Donna Warren, the night manager, shot twice in the head at close range in her main floor office containing the safe. The safe was opened using its combination and Donna Warren was the only staff member on site who knew the combination.
A little over $2,000.00 was stolen, as well as some other personal property.
Neil Burroughs, also a night cleaner, was found in the kitchen area of the main floor. He was shot three times in the head. One shot was a contact wound. The two others were from close range. His throat was cut so severely he would have died from that wound alone and he also suffered many other wounds.
Arleen MacNeil was found in the basement near the door at the foot of the stairs. She was shot in the head at close range. She has survived, but suffered permanent mental and physical disability until her death in 2018.
Justice J.A. Mathews, writing in dissent of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeals ruling in R. v. Muise, wrote:
7. There was nothing at the scene to suggest that the victims could or did fight back. All evidence supports the conclusion of execution-like killings. These victims did not have a chance.
8. An extensive police investigation and numerous court proceedings have conclusively determined that these egregious crimes were committed by three men acting together at the scene in furtherance of a planned robbery. These men are:
9. Darren Richard Muise (age 18 years at that time), the appellant herein, convicted of second degree murder of Neil Burroughs and robbery;
10. Freeman Daniel MacNeil (age 23 years), convicted of the first degree murder of Neil Burroughs, the second degree murder of James Fagan, the unlawful confinement of Donna Warren and robbery; and
11. Derek Anthony Wood (age 18 years), convicted of the first degree murders of Neil Burroughs and Donna Warren, the attempted murder of Arleen MacNeil, the unlawful confinement of Donna Warren, and robbery.
Sentencing
Derek Anthony Wood received two life sentences, one for the first-degree murders of Donna Warren and Neil Burroughs Jr., and a second for the attempted murder of Arlene MacNeil. He was also sentenced to two 10-year terms for unlawful confinement and armed robbery.
His application for day parole was rejected on April 8, 2015, stating:
“Given your … moderate to high risk for reoffending, the length of your incarceration, your violent institutional behaviour, your current segregation status, the special handling requirements in your case and your lack of engagement in addressing your risk factors, the board concluded that your release from a maximum security institution to a halfway house was not realistic or viable at this time.”
Wood was eligible for full parole in 2017, according to the Cape Breton Post, but it is unlikely he will ever be released.
Darren Muise was sentenced to 20 years before he was eligible for parole.
Muise was granted day parole on March 29, 2011, and was granted full parole on November 22, 2012. You can read the Parole Bord of Canada Pre-Release Decision Sheet here: Download PDF.
Freeman Daniel MacNeil was granted temporary unescorted absences from prison once a month in November, 2019, as a leadup to day parole this year. He was first granted escorted day passes in 2016.

thanks for the work you do.  I recall reading your posts in the Canadian Firearms Digest as far back as I have been a member, must be 20 years.
You may be interested in a book I wrote called No More Mr. Nice-guy: a guide to defending yourself, family and property in Canada.  If you would like a copy, simply send me an email, include your name so I recognize the request, include your address.
Cheers
btw.  a small group of use including 2 astute lawyers are planning on launching an aggressive charter challenge against the recent OiC.  If we find a larger group that will aggressively  assault this OiC we may through our weight behind that challenge.  Regardless we will do all we can to see it defeated.  I fear that if firearms owners done coalesce on this and beat it down then we are done.

The Sydney River McDonald&#39;s murders occurred on May 7, 1992. As the event’s name suggests, a shooting spree happened at the McDonald&#39;s restaurant in Sydney River, Nova Scotia, Canada. This quiet community on Cape Breton Island was not used to such gun violence, usually associated with big cities.
The shooting and robbery left three people dead, and one person survived with life-altering injuries that left them permanently disabled. The deceased victims were Neil Burroughs Jr., Jimmy Fagen, and Donna Warren. Arlene MacNeil survived her headwounds. The shooters stole just over $2,000 CAD from the restaurant’s safe.
That early morning robbery and shooting was committed by three young men, with one of them, Derek Wood, working for that McDonald’s restaurant. They were arrested about week later and all were convicted by the end of 1993 in separate trials. Today both Freeman Daniel MacNeil and Darren Muise are out on parole while Wood remains incarcerated. It was one of the highest-profile murder cases in Canada at the time.
Background
The Victims
Neil Burroughs Jr., aged 29, was a maintenance worker that served at McDonald’s restaurants in Industrial Cape Breton. He lived in Glace Bay with his wife and son. He was originally from the Cape Breton town of  Dominion.[1]
James “Jimmy” Fagan, aged 27, was a janitor from  Sydney. He was arriving for his 1:00 a.m. shift when he was shot.[2]
Arleen MacNeil, aged 20, was a worker at the restaurant. She was a business student at the University College of Cape Breton (now known as Cape Breton University). She lived in the  Point Aconi area of Industrial Cape Breton and was not related to the murderer with the same last name.[3] She was the only one of the four people shot that survived this attack.[1]
Donna Warren, aged 22, from  North Sydney. She was the  swing manager that night. She was a law student. She was the only one working that night that knew the combination to the safe where the money was stored.[2]
Robbery and murders
Derek Wood, 18, an employee of the restaurant along with two friends, Freeman Daniel MacNeil, 23, and Darren Muise, 18, broke into the restaurant after closing, planning to rob the establishment. They murdered their victims with a .22 calibre pistol, several knives, and a shovel. One victim survived after being shot in the face, but was left permanently disabled. Forcing an employee to open the restaurant&#39;s safe, they made off with $2,017.[4]
Community response
The murders put Sydney into the spotlight as this became a national news story. The restaurant was in the shopping district of Sydney River on Kings Road. It reopened on May 14, 1992 after RCMP officers and psychologists accompanied staff through a walk-through of the restaurant.[5] The building was demolished in 2000 and moved down the road to a more accessible location. The site of the former McDonald&#39;s is currently an empty lot.[6]
Trial and sentence
MacNeil and Wood were sentenced to life imprisonment with 25 years before parole eligibility. Muise received 20 years before parole eligibility.[4]
Parole dispositions
On March 29, 2011, the National Parole Board announced their decision to grant Muise day parole. A member stated: &#34;Given the significant and real progress you have made over the years, your case management team is of the opinion that the probability that you commit a crime after your release is low.&#34; He received full parole on November 22, 2012.[7]
On December 29, 2022, McNeil was granted day parole. The National Parole Board had rejected an application for parole by Wood earlier that year, claiming he was &#34;too high a risk to reoffend&#34;.[8]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Roger Wallace Warren (December 17, 1943 – July 24, 2019) was a Canadian miner who was convicted of nine counts of second-degree murder in connection to the September 18, 1992 Giant Mine bombings near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada.  Warren was convicted (in 1995) due to his confession to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
In 2003, Warren again confessed to the bombing, saying that he acted alone.[1] This second confession followed the decision by the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted, to drop their investigation of the case.[2]
During testimony at a July 2004 lawsuit (filed by the widows of the victims), Warren blamed poor security, his union (now part of the CAW union[3]) and the company that owned the mine, Royal Oak Mines Incorporated, for provoking him.  He claimed that a simple screen and padlock over a broken window would have dissuaded him, and that he was only capable of the bombing because strike-breakers had been &#34;dehumanized&#34; by his union.  He also claimed that &#34;(his) termination resulted in the deaths of nine men.&#34;[4]
He became eligible for parole in 2010, applied for day parole in mid-March 2014, and was granted after a hearing on June 17, 2014. At the hearing, he expressed regret for the murders.[5][6] He was granted full parole in 2017.[7]
Warren died on July 24, 2019 at the age of 75 in Abbotsford, British Columbia.[7]
Warren was portrayed by Frank Moore in the 1996 CBC Television film Giant Mine.
