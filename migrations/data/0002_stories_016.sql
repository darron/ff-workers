Some information may no longer be current.ShareLouise Russo, the woman badly wounded by an errant bullet while standing in a North York sandwich shop, was shot with a high-powered assault rifle normally used in military operations and rarely seen on the streets, Detective Brian Bott said yesterday.Displaying the sinister-looking semi-automatic weapon at a press conference yesterday, Det. Bott said Toronto police have determined that at least three people in a minivan pulled in front of California Sandwiches on April 21 and opened fire, striking Ms. Russo in the back and paralyzing her from the waist down.Det. Bott said he believes the drive-by shooting was not random, but made clear he thinks it highly unlikely that Ms. Russo, a 45-year-old mother of three teenagers, was the intended target.The head of a seven-member task force looking into the three-month-old case said, however, that he is unable to offer any plausible motive for the crime.&#34;I think there is a reason for it,&#34; Det. Bott said, adding, &#34;I don&#39;t know yet what that reason is.&#34;None of the other people in or around the shop at the time appeared to have reason to be targets of a drive-by shooting, he said.Det. Bott did say, however, that he is &#34;happy&#34; with the progress made by his task force so far, and that he is &#34;much more confident now than I was on April 26, when the task force was formed, that we will come to a successful conclusion.&#34;From her wheelchair yesterday, Ms. Russo told reporters gathered at police headquarters that every day since she was shot has been a &#34;struggle&#34; and that she still is feeling &#34;very weak.&#34;&#34;This has totally changed my life and the life of my family,&#34; she said, flanked by husband Sam, sister Rose and other members of her family.&#34;I could have easily been your mother, your wife, your sister or your daughter,&#34; she said, appealing to the public, urging anyone with information about the shooters or the case to come forward.&#34;If you know anything, please call,&#34; she added, tears flowing from her eyes.Ms. Russo was shot on the evening of April 21 when she went to buy a veal sandwich as a treat for 15-year-old Krista, her youngest daughter who was waiting outside the store in a van.While Ms. Russo was buying the sandwich, as many as 20 bullets came flying through the window of the store, one of which grazed her head. Another bullet went into her back, shattering vertebrae and breaking a rib.Still obviously distraught yesterday, Ms. Russo did not get into the details of how her life has changed, except to say she has been constantly enduring extreme amounts of &#34;physical emotional and mental anguish . . . each and every day.&#34;In previous interviews, she has said the incident has been a huge burden, not only because of the challenges of her own injuries, but because she has a 16-year-old daughter with a rare genetic disease who needs round-the-clock care.Det. Bott said police had recovered a Colt AR-15 assault rifle not long after the incident at a location near the scene, and that it has now been conclusively linked to the shooting. After tracing the serial number, police determined that the weapon had been stolen in a break and enter within the province 11 years ago, he said.He added that while the weapon can be legally bought by consumers, it is mostly used for target practice. It is also the type of rifle used by some militaries and by Toronto&#39;s Emergency Task Force.&#34;We very rarely run into those weapons [on the street]&#34; he said. &#34;I personally have never seen one before used in an incident.&#34;Det. Bott added that a second weapon, likely a handgun, was also used in the shooting but has yet to be recovered. Police believe two people fired their weapons out the open sliding door of a van that pulled up to the store just before the shooting.Follow us on Twitter: @globeandmailOpens in a new windowReport an errorEditorial code of conductTerms &amp; ConditionsCommunity GuidelinesPrivacy PolicyDisclaimerSkip footer navigationSubscribeDigital + Home DeliveryDigital AccessGlobe2GoThe New York TimesGlobe Email NewslettersGift SubscriptionBusiness servicesAdvertise with UsGroup SubscriptionsGlobe CampusContent LicensingDataStoreReport On Business Top 1000Globe Event CentreSophi.ioContact usAddress and Phone NumberPublic EditorStaffStaff PGP DirectorySecureDropSubmit an articleReader servicesMy globeandmail.com AccountTechnical Support &amp; FAQsManage my home deliveryManage my privacy preferencesManage my advertising preferencesMember BenefitsAbout usCompany informationWork at The GlobeAccessibilityEditorial Code of ConductSustainabilityLicensing &amp; PermissionsElection Advertising RegistrySubscribeDigital + Home DeliveryDigital AccessGlobe2GoThe New York TimesGlobe Email NewslettersGift SubscriptionBusiness servicesAdvertise with UsGroup SubscriptionsGlobe CampusContent LicensingDataStoreReport On Business Top 1000Globe Event CentreSophi.ioContact usAddress and Phone NumberPublic EditorStaffStaff PGP DirectorySecureDropSubmit an articleReader servicesMy globeandmail.com AccountTechnical Support &amp; FAQsManage my home deliveryManage my privacy preferencesManage my advertising preferencesMember BenefitsAbout usCompany informationWork at The GlobeAccessibilityEditorial Code of ConductSustainabilityLicensing &amp; PermissionsElection Advertising RegistryReturn to start of footer navigation© Copyright 2023 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Dustin Joseph Paul, Cocaine and the 2004 Penticton Indian Reserve Shooting
Published October 30, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime, Guns
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.
On October 30, 2004, self-confessed drug dealer Dustin Joseph Paul snorted four scoops of cocaine through a Slurpee straw to try sober up at a drug-fuelled bush party on the Penticton Indian Reserve.
After snorting the cocaine, Dustin Paul began thinking about his life.
“I was just thinking about how my life hasn’t turned out the way I wanted and how — why did my dad have to die, and what’s up with this life. Like, who put me here, why am I here, is this life even real? I started to think then about death. If this life isn’t real, what’s death? Is it to wake up in a better life, or even a human life?”
At this point he felt pretty good, but Paul was on the tail end of a 24-hour bender during which he consumed 15 rum and cokes at a strip club, at least another 20 beer at various party locations, and massive amounts of cocaine and some marijuana.
After his brief self-inquiry, Dustin Paul walked to his truck, grabbed a 9mm pistol and began shooting people, starting with his friend, Tommy Gabriel. Paul walked up to Gabriel and shot him in the face.
Miraculously, Gabriel survived the attempt on his life.
With one friend down, Dustin Paul turned his attention to a small group of friends. First, he shot Damien Endreny twice in the back and once in the face. Then he shot his cousin, Quincy Paul in the head and, finally, shot Robin Baptiste in the right eye.
The three men died almost instantly.
Billy Louie, Tommy Gabriel’s brother, was standing behind Tommy when he was killed. As his brother’s body fell to the ground, Billy Louie ran down a trail to escape but when he encountered thick brush he could not penetrate, Billy ran for the nearby creek instead.
Dustin Paul ran after Billy Louie and found him in the creek about 20 feed away.  Billy was up to his neck in water, doing his best to hide from his attacker. He begged for his life but Dustin Paul “acted like he couldn’t hear me, and then he just — he shot me.”
Billy Louie took two bullets to the arm and turned his face into the water, pretending to be dead.
It worked. Dustin Paul stopped shooting at him and moved on to another target: himself.

Killer Attempts Suicide
As so often happens in unplanned mass murders, Dustin Paul tried to kill himself to avoid facing justice for his crimes.
When Dustin Paul finished shooting at Billy Louie, he put down his handgun, walked into the creek, pulled out a knife and slashed his own throat deeply on both sides before turning himself face down in the creek.
When Penticton RCMP Constable Keith Rogers arrived at the scene he found the bodies of Damien Endreny, Quincy Paul and Robin Baptiste lying on the ground in the picnic area. Someone told him there was another body in the creek, so Constable Rogers headed in that direction.
When he arrived at the creek he saw someone floating face-down about 50 metres downstream. As he waded into the creek, Constable Rogers noticed the person in the water wore a backpack on his back so, when he grabbed onto the body and flipped it over, he grabbed onto one of the shoulder straps and the man’s belt to pull face out of the water.
That’s when Constable Rogers noticed gaping wounds along both sides of the person’s throat.
Constable Rogers tried to communicate with Dustin Paul, asking him if he was hurt, who did this to him and similar questions. Dustin Paul didn’t respond verbally to any of the constable’s questions.
When asked whether there was any sort of reaction at all to his questions, Constable Rogers testified:
“Yes. Every now and then, that he would just turn his head, look up at me. He had a very, very blank dark look in his eyes. I couldn’t tell if he comprehended I was there or understood what I was asking him. And then he would turn and put his face into the water.”
Constable Rogers said Dustin Paul had no reaction except to continue, five or six times, to put his face back in the water. Eventually other constables arrived to assist Constable Rogers and they pulled Dustin Paul out of the creek and placed him in an ambulance.
Dustin Paul was taken to hospital where he remained for three days to heal from surgery to repair the damage of his self-inflicted wounds.
He was charged with three counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.

The Trial
At trial, Dustin Paul testified in his own defence.
He said that he was 23 years of age when the shootings took place. At the time he was studying for his welder’s ticket.
His father, a drug dealer, was murdered when Dustin Paul was 19 years old. Like his father before him, Dustin Paul also sold drugs to earn a living.
He viewed himself as a moderate user of cocaine and marijuana. [yet testified to walking around with a baggie full of cocaine and snorting from it repeatedly over the prior 24 hours.]
Dustin Paul lived with his mother on the Penticton Indian Band Reserve at the time of the shootings because he recently broke up with his girlfriend of seven years.
He said he remembered shooting Billy Louie, but had no memory of shooting Tommy Gabriel, Damien Endreny, Robin Baptise, or Quincy Paul.
He accepted that he shot all five people, although he had no reason to be angry with any of them.
He had no explanation for shooting his cousin and his friends, but felt terrible for doing it.
After deliberating for two days and seeking clarification from the judge, the jury returned a guilty verdict on three counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.

Conviction, Sentencing and Appeals
On September 13, 2006 Dustin Joseph Paul was convicted of all five counts after a jury trial in Penticton before Justice Duncan W. Shaw in BC Supreme Court.
On April 4, 2007, Justice Shaw sentenced Dustin Joseph Paul to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for 16 years.
[3] … Mr. Paul in particular had been taking cocaine, marihuana and alcohol for in excess of 24 hours. He was a local drug dealer and provided cocaine to others who were present. During the course of the night and the next morning, there had been several fights. Although Mr. Paul was not directly involved in the fights, they were between members who were his particular friends and other members who were not.
[4] Mr. Paul had been a drug dealer for a few years prior to the murders. He followed in the footsteps of his father, whose career as a drug dealer ended with him being murdered. Mr. Paul was not known as a man of violence. However, a few weeks before the murders, he bought a semi-automatic handgun for his own protection as a drug dealer. He kept it fully loaded in his truck.
His truck was at the picnic site, and moments before the murders he went to the truck, took out the gun, and returned to the group with his gun in hand. At this point, he was so heavily intoxicated that he was in what the Crown and defence psychiatrists described at the trial as a transient psychotic state. He proceeded to shoot his victims in the head, mostly from point-blank range.
On February 4, 2011, Dustin Paul’s appeal to have his parole eligibility reduced to 10 years was dismissed, as was his subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Community Response
“What happened on Oct. 30, 2004, was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of drug dealing and drug activities in our communities,” said Stewart Phillips, chief of the Penticton Indian Band in 2006.
“That awareness is the only hope we have of working together and eradicating this.”
The triple homicide emotionally devastated families and created a high level of awareness of the drug-dealing activities by organized crime in native communities, he said, and hoped this would be the wakeup call his community needed.
I believe it was.
Today, Chief Chad Eneas and the Penticton Indian Band offer an array of treatment programs to help band members recover from drug and alcohol addictions and mental health issues.
In 2013, the Penticton Indian Band developed a Comprehensive Community Plan to:
Establish goals, directions and broad development strategies to guide the future growth of the Penticton Indian Band
Provide policy guidance for development, programs, budgets, actions and services
Provide a basis for coordinating general land use decisions
Provide a degree of certainty for Penticton Indian Band community members and the surrounding municipalities and governments
If you’re interested in learning more about how the Comprehensive Community Plan is helping improve all aspects of life for their members, please read this document or watch this 12-minute video.

Remembering Mayerthorpe RCMP’s Fallen Four
Published March 2, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Firearm Prohibition Orders, Guns, In Memoriam -- Remembering our Heros, Officer Down, Police, Violent Criminals
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.
On March 3, 2005, a violent man with a long criminal history and a lifetime firearms prohibition order against him used an illegal gun to murder four RCMP constables in Mayerthorpe, Alberta.

Firearm Prohibition Order Failure
The Mayerthorpe Fallen Four aren’t dead because they ignored RCMP policy or procedure. They’re dead because our government refuses to track dangerous violent offenders with Firearm Prohibition Orders.
Roszko maintained a large marijuana grow-op inside the Quonset and the trailer. He also ran a “chop shop” for stolen vehicles in it. These were both long-running criminal enterprises police were totally unaware of. Had legislation existed at the time allowing police to check on dangerous offender like James Roszko, these four RCMP members would probably still be alive today.
We cannot continue to ignore the most violent offenders in our nation. This is a public safety threat no political party or government is willing to address.
How many more RCMP members must die until this changes?

The Fatality Inquiry
The fatality report (view PDF) resulting from the inquiry into the deaths of Mayerthorpe’s Fallen Four shows Cpl. James Martin, the senior officer on the case, knew of James Roszko’s criminal record, his firearms prohibition order and his violent background.
Despite this, Cpl. Martin decided not to activate an ERT team yet, even though “we were probably going to need ERT to assist us in executing his arrest warrants.”
An ERT is often activated to deal with suspects known or believed to be armed. Those criteria did not yet exist at the time this decision was made. That changed shortly after the search began.
Police discovered .308 and 9mm ammunition, proving Roszko was in breach of his firearms prohibition order, although no guns were found with the ammunition.
By 3am on March 3rd, Cpl. Martin and Sgt. Pinder, the two senior officers on scene, knew the following (see page 7):
They knew Roszko had fled about 12 hours earlier and had not been seen since. They knew Roszko had a history of violence. They knew Roszko was somewhat strange, given the spike belt incident and the other anecdotal information they had heard from detachment staff.
They knew ammunition had been found and that this implied a substantial risk that Roszko could possess firearms notwithstanding his prohibition from doing so. They had alerted all members to look out for firearms on the property but to this point none had been located.
They understood there was a potential for Roszko to return while, at least, Cst. Johnston and Cst. Gordon were there. That said, they also knew from long experience that individuals fleeing a police presence do not typically return to the scene.
No one was aware of any circumstance where an individual had fled the police only to return with the intent to do serious harm.
Officers Down
Unknown to Constable Johnston and Constable Gordon, the two RCMP members remaining on site to secure the location until other investigators returned, “at some point between approximately 3:30 to 4:00 am and 10:00 am on March 3, 2005, Roszko gained access to the Quonset.”
He remained undetected until approximately 10:00 am, when he used a Heckler &amp; Koch .308 semi-automatic rifle to shoot and kill Constables Gordon, Johnston, Myrol and Schiemann right after they entered the Quonset.
The medical evidence is incontrovertible that none of the victims would have survived their grievous injuries. All would have been unconscious within seconds and no one would have survived for more than a minute.
Roszko “casually” walked out the front of the Quonset hut with a handgun in his belt, a hunting rifle slung across his back and the Heckler &amp; Koch .308 rifle in his hands. At this point he apparently thought he killed all RCMP officers on scene, a belief supported by the inquiry’s report.
Then he saw Constable Stephen Vigor.
“He appeared to have a surprised look on his face. I don’t think he expected to see another police officer or another person there,” Vigor told the inquest.
Roszko fired at Vigor, who escaped injury and returned fire, hitting Roszko twice, once in the left hand and once in the right thigh, fracturing his femur.
“This fact bears directly on all that follows because we now know that the incident was effectively over [at this point],” the report said.
Roszko committed suicide almost immediately after staggering back inside the Quonset.

How many more RCMP members must die until this changes?
If you, like me, want to see violent criminal offenders tracked, please write to the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Public Safety and demand they introduce legislation to prevent more tragedies like this.

Prohibition Orders do not work. And depending on the definition of “tracking”, “tracking” likely would not work either. I have a PAL and am supposedly “tracked” in the way that some have called for the tracking of criminals. My PAL and the “tracking” that goes with it certainly would not stop me from doing harm if I chose to. An effective “tracking” method would be 24/7 chaperoning by a police officer or two. But as a taxpayer I certainly do not agree with such a measure.
Keep violent offenders locked up in prison until a panel of judges is willing to put their careers and everything they own on the line to say that that person is ready for release into society and trusted to be free (yes with such conditions I imagine every offender would do their full sentence as no parole board would risk it).
Once early parole is nearly eliminated, move the onus onto sentencing judges. If a judge gives less than the maximum prison term written into the law for a violent crime, they become liable if that person reoffends when let out (let’s say just within the period that the max sentence would have covered). Similar to the parole boards, judges would likely not risk giving less than the maximum very often.
Once sentencing becomes giving the max as per the act/law most of the time, move the onus onto politicians to amend laws with appropriate maximum sentences for violent crimes until a balance is reached where recidivism becomes a statistical anomaly.
(and as always, let the would-be victims be armed to end the violent criminal to avoid all of the above in the first place)

That would mean supporting existing Laws to the Limit……Jails/Prisons would be overflowing, requiring more Jails/Prisons……..Taxes would be raised or Elected officials Pay reduced and Government Downsized …….What a terrible thought????

I agree with Joe, for most of his post, but feel we need to be more forceful with regard to his final sentence!
If we are truly a free society (we’re not) we should be able to carry a firearm for not only personal and close family member self defense, but also to assist police in times of emergency, as well as being willing to stand up toward miscreants that prey on our society as well.! Before everyone gasps at the thought of this, I, as a law abiding firearms owner, would be willing to pay for any mandated training, background checks, lie detection tests, In fact any mutually agreed upon testing that will confirm I am not a threat to myself or the society I live within and try to support. Of course the people on the fuzzy left, that could not trust themselves to own firearms, (due I suspect, to the fact they know they themselves CANNOT control their emotions.) They would never trust any citizen to carry a firearm in a responsible manner. Yet they trust the RCMP with that same ability even with the mediocre firearms training the rank and file does get. Of course, it doesn’t have to make sense, it’s the government! Yeah, well look where that has gotten us.

The Dawson College shooting occurred on September 13, 2006, at Dawson College, a CEGEP located in  downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The perpetrator, Kimveer Singh Gill, began shooting outside the de Maisonneuve Boulevard entrance to the school, and moved towards the atrium by the cafeteria on the main floor.[1][2] One victim died at the scene, while another 19 were injured, eight of whom were listed in critical condition, with six requiring surgery.[3][4][5] The shooter later committed suicide, after being shot in the arm by a police officer.[6] It was the third fatal school shooting in Montreal, after the École Polytechnique massacre in 1989 and the shooting spree at Concordia University in 1992.
Shooting[edit]
1. 12:30: Shooter exits his car.2. 12:41: First shots fired outside entrance.3. 12:44: Nearby officers rush to the scene.4. 12:42–12:48: Gunman fires on students in the cafeteria. Police shoot him in the arm, he kills himself with a shot to the head.5. 1:30: Killer&#39;s body is dragged outside and covered.
At 12:30 p.m. EDT, Gill parked his car on de Maisonneuve Boulevard near the college campus and was seen removing weapons from his trunk by bystanders. Gill briefly took a passerby hostage and forced him to carry a bag containing a fourth gun and additional ammunition. Gill opened fire at students outside on the steps of Dawson College at its rear entrance with a semi-automatic carbine, and the passerby fled the melee, leaving Gill&#39;s bag.[7]
Gill then entered the school and made his way to the cafeteria, almost directly ahead of the school entrance. He positioned himself in the corner of the building, near the microwave oven, and set his bag on the floor. He loaded a pistol, fired a shot into the floor and then shot students who were standing in front of him. He then raised his weapon and ordered the remaining students to lie down on the floor. He continued shooting at students until confronted by two police officers who had been visiting the school at the time regarding an unrelated incident. The police officers entered after hearing the gunfire, and rushed to the cafeteria. Additional police officers surrounded the campus. Confronted by police officers in the school cafeteria, Gill briefly took two more people hostage.[8]
He was shot in the arm by police officer Denis Côté and then committed suicide via a gunshot wound to the head at 12:48 EDT.[6] The police officers attempted to resuscitate him, but failed. At 1:30 p.m., police officers dragged his body outside the building, covered it with a yellow bag, then continued the evacuation and the search for possible accomplices.[9][10]  Authorities concluded the attack was premeditated, after a short suicide note was found on Gill&#39;s body during the autopsy.[11]
The television network TVA reported that security camera footage from Place Alexis Nihon showed Gill staking out the area as far back as August 10, more than a month before the shootings.[7][12]
Victims[edit]
The police confirmed the death of one victim, an 18-year-old woman who was shot in the abdomen and died on the scene.[3] Canadian newspapers later identified the woman as Anastasia Rebecca De Sousa.[13]
The Montreal Police Service later reported that 19 other people had been wounded.[4] One victim, who was reportedly at Dawson College to visit friends, suffered two shots to the head.  He underwent intensive surgery; the doctors removed one bullet, and he remained in a coma for one week after the shooting as doctors determined whether they should try to remove the second bullet.[14] After two weeks on a ventilator, he emerged from the coma and as of 3 November 2006[update] was recovering.[15]
Investigation[edit]
Police initially looked for as many as three suspects, but Montreal Police Chief Yvan Delorme later confirmed that there was only one shooter, who shot himself fatally on the scene.[4] Many eyewitnesses described a man with a Mohawk hairstyle, wearing a black trenchcoat,[16] black trousers with metal studs, and combat boots. The suspect carried three weapons, including a semi-automatic carbine.[17]
That evening, a Sûreté du Québec spokesperson confirmed to LCN TV reporters that the shooter was a 25-year-old male, born in Québec.[18] Police found his car, a black Pontiac Sunfire, parked close to the school, and later searched the house where he lived with his mother, seizing a computer and other belongings.[19]
Around midnight on Wednesday, police confirmed to the media that the suspect was Kimveer Gill, a 25-year-old Laval resident, a graduate from Rosemere High School.[20] An autopsy later revealed that Gill committed suicide after being hit in the arm by police officer Denis Côté&#39;s gunfire.[21] It was revealed that Gill&#39;s actions were premeditated; a short suicide note was found on Gill&#39;s body.[11]
During a police search at Gill&#39;s home, an apology note to his family was found. In addition, police seized firearm accessories including holsters and manuals, including those of the firearm he used during attack; they also found a letter praising the actions of Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.[22]

Police cordoned off the campus area and swept the school for students left inside.[23] Local radio reports placed the number of police vehicles at approximately 80 and up to 24 ambulances surrounded the building. Students and faculty were evacuated from the campus or left the vicinity of the shooting.
Two shopping centres adjacent to Dawson, Place Alexis Nihon and Westmount Square, directly linked to the Atwater metro station, were evacuated and the green line of the Montreal Metro was shut down for several hours between Lionel-Groulx and McGill.[24] The Pepsi Forum entertainment centre, opposite the eastern corner of Dawson, was open when many of the students came running into the premises moments after the shooting began. Shortly afterward, the Pepsi Forum went into lockdown under the directives of the Montreal Police. Eventually, one of the Forum&#39;s entrances onto St. Catherine Street re-opened under police/security guard to allow monitored access and egress.
Sign on the door of a downtown Montreal metro station in the afternoon of the shooting, inviting Dawson students to Concordia University for shelter while subway service is halted.
A large number of the evacuees were also directed to the nearby Concordia University, where the Concordia Student Union (CSU) is located. The CSU cancelled all remaining Orientation activities, and instead used its venues to temporarily shelter the evacuated Dawson students and provide them with food, water, blankets, and phones to reach other loved ones. A coordination team was put in place from the CSU, and the DSU used the Sir George Williams campus as a temporary crisis centre and offered counselling (psychologist, psychiatrist) to traumatized students and staff. Claude Dauphin (Mayor of the borough of Lachine and Vice-President of the City of Montreal executive committee) had a very close relationship with both of the student unions during the night of the events; Dauphin went to the CSU office&#39;s the night of the shooting to meet with both unions to inform them of what the city was doing, and to ask how he could help.
The police also established several phone numbers for parents and friends of the students.[25]
Police reported that they needed a few days to process the crime scene. As a result, officials from Dawson College stated that the school would be closed until Monday, September 18, 2006,[26] scheduled to open its doors at 11:00 a.m. and remain open until 7:00 p.m. and have an &#34;Open House&#34; feel to the day. Classes were scheduled to resume as usual on Tuesday, September 19, 2006.
A follow-up study conducted by the McGill University Health Centre Research Institute found that 30% of Dawson students at the time of the shooting suffered mental health consequences including post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, alcohol dependence, and social phobia, a level twice that found in the general population. Approximately 18% of respondents developed a mental health disorder despite never having had one before.[27][28]
Perpetrator[edit]
Kimveer Gill was a 25-year-old Canadian born on 9 July 1981 in Lachine, Quebec, Canada. His parents were of Punjabi descent, and moved to Saint-Laurent, Quebec from India in early 1981.[29]  The family later settled in the Fabreville area of Laval, Quebec in 1987. Kimveer attended Twin Oaks Elementary School in Laval from 1988 to 1993.
Gill later attended Rosemere High School, where he was remembered by teachers as quiet and unassuming. Despite early media reports, he performed well academically, and most students remember him as having friends and certainly never being bullied.[30] Kimveer graduated from Rosemere High School in June 1998. He enrolled in Vanier College with his friends Steven Kulczycki, Andrew Page, and Jason Rust. However, he dropped out in January 1999.
Gill briefly received military training from the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, from January 17 to February 16, 1999. He had told his friends he wished to eventually become a mercenary. He did not complete his basic training for unknown reasons.[12]  He was deemed unsuitable for military service and was voluntarily discharged before receiving extensive weapons training. Gill was a member of a rifle club and visited the Ville Saint-Pierre facility the day prior to the shooting.[31][32]
The killer&#39;s profile was discovered on a website called VampireFreaks under the screen name &#34;fatality666.&#34;  The last login was at 10:35 a.m. on the day of the shooting.[33] The profile was subsequently restricted to registered users, and then removed entirely.
Firearms[edit]
Gill was armed with a Beretta Cx4 Storm pistol-caliber carbine,[34] a Glock pistol (reports are conflicting as to whether this was chambered in 9mm or .45 ACP), and a shotgun. He fired sixty shots, ten of which were fired outside the school. With the exception of five shots from his pistol, including the one to kill himself, all the shots came from the rifle.[35]
There were reports of an additional firearm in a bag that he forced a hostage to bring along as he arrived near the campus site. According to TVA&#39;s crime reporter Claude Poirier, Gill briefly held a lawyer hostage and demanded that he bring the bag containing the fourth gun and additional ammunition. When the first shots were fired and police arrived, the lawyer fled the scene and hid Gill&#39;s bag.[7]
Gill had a restricted firearm license. His firearms were registered with the Canadian gun registry. The transportation, storage, and use of his firearms in the incident were not legal as per firearms regulation in Canada, despite the acquisition and possession being legal.
Response[edit]
Two days after the event, people bring flowers to the de Maisonneuve entrance, where the first shots had been fired.
Students and faculty[edit]
Some student leaders criticized the immediate response of the Dawson College administration. The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that &#34;if it hadn&#39;t been for help from the Student Union at nearby Concordia University... many of the Dawson students would have had no one to turn to for help.&#34;[36]
Dawson&#39;s director-general Richard Filion called the student charges harsh.
&#34;We did our best to evacuate the building. We were in a state of shock. We were scattered everywhere around the city,&#34; Filion said, noting many staff members were out on lunch break.
Dawson does have an emergency plan, he said, but it was designed with fire safety in mind.[37]
Filion announced that staff and faculty would return to the College on Friday, September 15, and that classes would resume on Tuesday, September 19, 2006. The school invited all students to join them on Monday, September 18, 2006 to meet with staff and faculty for information and support, as well as to retrieve belongings that had been left behind. It was announced that grief counseling and support services would be available on an ongoing basis.
In addition, one of the victims, 18-year-old Hayder Kadhim, who received two bullet wounds to the head and neck, challenged Prime Minister Stephen Harper to a gun control debate in a public speech on CBC in response to the shooting.[38]
Politicians[edit]
Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated the shootings were &#34;...a cowardly and senseless act of violence...&#34;[39][40]
Interim Liberal Party leader Bill Graham and Member of Parliament (MP) Lucienne Robillard: &#34;We must act as a country to show our compassion for those whose lives have been dramatically altered by this inexplicable event.&#34;[40]
Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe: &#34;It&#39;s tragic. We can never explain why these things happen. At the Polytechnique women were targeted. But here, we have no idea.&#34; Duceppe also suggested the need for a national gun registry.[40]
New Democratic Party Leader Jack Layton mentioned that it &#34;was a grim reminder of previous school shootings&#34; and that it hit particularly close to home for him;[40] Layton was born and raised in a suburb of Montreal and attended McGill University, a short distance from Dawson College.
Quebec Premier Jean Charest stated &#34;We are deeply saddened for the victims, the families, the parents of the children who study at Dawson.&#34;[16][40]
Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay stated &#34;This is so tragic. How do we talk to the parents who are going through this? All I can say is that I feel for them, and I care for them.&#34;[17]
Video gaming community[edit]
Danny Ledonne, creator of Super Columbine Massacre RPG!, expressed his sorrow[41] at the shootings, asked members of his web site to &#34;... be aware of the sensitive nature of Montreal right now and of those who were affected by this shooting,&#34; and explained how his game is not designed to train shooters.[42]
Ian Bogost of Water Cooler Games[43] says &#34;A tragedy like this saddens and disturbs us all... Gill was a disturbed man [...] he clearly needed help he did not get.&#34;
Complaints about media coverage[edit]
Monique Lépine (mother of Marc Lépine, the perpetrator of the École Polytechnique massacre) spoke out in wake of the shooting, the first time she had ever done so since her son&#39;s massacre 16 years prior.[44]
Jan Wong controversy[edit]
Main article: Jan Wong controversy
An immediate controversy arose about an article regarding the Dawson shootings by journalist Jan Wong, of the Toronto-based The Globe and Mail. Three days after the event, Wong, who was born and raised in Montreal and is the daughter of Chinese immigrants, wrote a front-page piece titled Get under the desk, in which she drew a link between all three school shootings in Quebec history (the École Polytechnique, the Concordia University and the Dawson College killings) and the nature of Quebec society under its protective language laws.[45]
Wong suggested the fact that the three perpetrators were not old-stock French Quebecers (the shooters were Algerian, Belarusian, and Punjabi in descent) was related to their murderous actions since, she claimed, they were alienated from a Quebec society concerned with &#34;racial purity.&#34; Accused of &#34;Quebec bashing,&#34; Wong&#39;s writing soon created public outcry in Quebec and political condemnation. Quebec Premier Jean Charest called the article a &#34;disgrace&#34;, stating that it &#34;betrays an ignorance of Canadian values and a profound misunderstanding of Québec.&#34;[46] On September 20, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper pronounced it &#34;prejudiced, absurd, irresponsible and without foundation&#34;;[47] the same day, the House of Commons of Canada unanimously passed a motion requesting an apology for the column.[48]
Wong&#39;s writing followed the comments of Professor Elliott Leyton, a social-anthropologist who is a widely consulted expert on serial homicide.[49]
Interviewed by CBC Newsworld on September 14, 2006 about the Dawson College shooting, Leyton stated that because all three such murderous rampages in Quebec involved a killer who was either an immigrant or a child of immigrants, it warranted an examination of government and societal attitudes.
Broadcast Code violation[edit]
In 2007, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council faulted CKNW, a radio station in Vancouver, British Columbia for airing &#34;potentially dangerous information&#34; during the Dawson College shooting. During the incident, CKNW had simulcast content from its sister stations in Montreal which included students speaking by cellphone from inside the school. A Vancouver man complained that the content could have told the gunman where the students were. The council said that as a result of modern technology reducing geographic distance as a barrier, CKNW had breached Section 10 (coverage of violent situations) of the broadcast code. The station broadcast the decision as required, but did not air an apology.[50]
Megadeth[edit]
Gill mentioned the song &#34;A Tout le Monde&#34; by the thrash metal band Megadeth on his blog on VampireFreaks.com on the day of the shooting. Megadeth was blamed for the shooting by many news outlets and watchdog groups as a result.
Later in 2006, Megadeth performed live in Montreal, and responded to the blame that had been placed on the band and their music as a result. Band leader Dave Mustaine told the crowd:
The guy who went to Dawson College and shot everyone, it&#39;s terrible. Aside from the fact that what he did was wrong, we have a relationship with Montreal, and that really pissed us off.
Before the concert in an interview for CBC News Mustaine said:
I was so angry that this guy would use my song, and that he would try and turn that beautiful song into something ugly and nasty. It&#39;s for those who lost their lives, and it&#39;s a gift to those who are in the process of healing (...) and Gill was not worthy of being a Megadeth fan.[51]
Natural Born Killers[edit]
See also: Natural Born Killers copycat crimes § Dawson College shooting
This is the ninth mass killing[52] to implicate the movie Natural Born Killers, per the gunman&#39;s blog at vampirefreaks.com, which he called one of his favourites. At some point prior to September 20, 2006, the blog was deleted.

Richardson Family Murders: How a 300-year-old werewolf helped a 12-year-old girl become Canada’s youngest multiple murderer
Published April 27, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.
The Richardson Family Murders is the bizarre story of
a 23-year-old high school dropout who claimed to be a 300-year-old blood-drinking werewolf,
the 12-year-old girl who manipulated him to do her bidding, and
parents desperate to regain control of their deeply troubled daughter.
When her parents ordered the 12-year-old to stop seeing the man eleven years her senior, they unwittingly signed their own death warrants.
This case is also exposes the utter uselessness of a Youth Criminal Justice Act publication ban. While I could (and would) be charged for violating the publication ban if I printed the daughter’s name, Canada’s publication ban only applies to Canadian media outlets.
You can discover the young killer’s name in 7 seconds or less by searching the web. Her name is everywhere.
It doesn’t have to make sense. It’s government policy.
Youth Criminal Justice Act Publication Restrictions
Identity of offender not to be published
110(1) Subject to this section, no person shall publish the name of a young person, or any other information related to a young person, if it would identify the young person as a young person dealt with under this Act.
Quick Facts
On April 23, 2006, the bodies of Debra Richardson, 48, and her husband Marc, 42, were discovered in the basement of their Medicine Hat home. Both were stabbed multiple times until they died.
Their 8-year-old son Jacob was found upstairs in his bedroom, his throat cut and his bed drenched in the child’s blood.
Their 12-year-old daughter was nowhere to be found and initially police thought she was kidnapped by the murderer.
She was not kidnapped by the murderer.
She was the murderer.
Runaway Devil
The convicted triple murderer, dubbed Runaway Devil by journalist and former Calgary Herald staff writer Sherri Zickefoose, cannot be named due to a publication ban under Canada’s Youth Criminal Justice Act.  Zickefoose coined the moniker to address this conundrum to allow her to write about the youngest mass killer in Canadian history while avoiding contempt of court charges.
Runaway Devil was no ordinary 12-year-old girl. She looked and dressed far older and, if you see any of the pictures published of her outside of Canada, you’ll understand what I mean. She was smart, pretty and easily manipulated the emotionally challenged Jeremy Steinke into doing whatever she wanted.
Here’s an excerpt from reporter and author Sherri Zickefoose, who discusses the case on her blog.
Covering the Medicine Hat murders was like no other reporting experience I’ve ever had in nearly 20 years in journalism. Hours after the news broke that police were investigating deaths inside a family home, I had travelled 300 km southeast from the Calgary Herald newsroom to stand on the sidewalk at the scene with a notebook and endless questions.
Our presumption – callous but practical to deadline decision makers in newsrooms everywhere – was that it was possibly another tragic case of domestic violence; a murder-suicide. As the hours ticked past, the real tale began emerging and the story spilling. A Grade 7 classmate told me J.R. wasn’t missing: she had run off with her older boyfriend in a grey truck and online she called herself Runaway Devil.
My colleague Robert Remington crossed paths with a teenage mom who said she’d left a raucous afternoon house party with her newborn baby after a kissing and giggling couple made her feel uncomfortable. The amorous pair was none other than J.R. and her boyfriend, Jeremy Steinke, just hours after the murders. Steinke told his friends he was a 300-year-old werewolf and that he liked to drink blood.
The ill-matched pair plotted to stay together when the girl’s parents kept them apart. J.R. was the architect of the crime: “So I have this plan,” she messaged Steinke, who went by the user name Souleater. “It starts with me killing them and ends with me living with you.”
In the decade after the crime, I have to wonder if anything has really changed. The lives of grieving family members are regrettably still darkened and diminished by the kind of damage that only comes from murder. A little neighbour boy, now a handsome high schooler, surrendered his innocence after coming to play and instead discovering the bloodied bodies of the dead through a window.
On this sad anniversary, police officers and other first responders with long memories vow to replace the gore and horror they saw by choosing to think of the family in happier times. If they can.
What’s woefully missing 10 years after the killings is any kind of significant national conversation about childhood mental illness and supportive resources for parents. Have we learned anything from the nightmare that befell the family? Has anything improved since the desperate Medicine Hat father and mother sought help for a daughter they couldn’t control?
She was always two steps ahead of them, able to manipulate and outsmart any boundaries her parents tried to enforce. Mental health experts have since said J.R. is afflicted with oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder. To most, that looks an awful lot like tantrums and disobedience, not uncommon in childhood.
The murders of J.R.’s father, mother and young brother were needless, of course. Because the courts must protect J.R.’s identity in order to fulfil efforts to rehabilitate her, the family’s legacy remains shrouded in secrecy. They were, in fact, loving parents who were building a better life for their young family.
The family’s struggle was no secret. The parents told many in their circle of the problems they were having with their daughter. Family therapy wasn’t working. They were fighting hard to rein in their wilful and headstrong daughter in the weeks leading up to the tragedy. Their legacy deserves to reflect that.
And I guess that’s where the rub is. J.R.’s records are sealed, but can anything be learned from her mental health case? We are left to hope that her case can be used to improve children’s mental health detection and support for parents looking for crucial answers.
The Runaway Devil 14 Years Later
The maximum sentence a young offender can receive for murder, no matter how many people they kill, is ten years. By the time she completed her custodial sentence in 2017, Runaway Devil had spent almost half her life incarcerated.
JR aka The Runaway Devil, completed her youth sentence for three counts of first-degree murder. She is now 27 years old with a new identity. Her accomplice in the murders of her entire family remains in prison.
By all accounts I can find, JR successfully convinced her psychiatric care handlers and a judge she poses no further threat to society – that she is a new woman intent on getting on with her life.
If you were to meet JR today you would never know it. Her identity is shielded by a system more concerned with protecting a triple-murderer’s privacy than it is with public safety.
