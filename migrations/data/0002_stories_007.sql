Dale Merle Nelson’s 1970 Murder Spree in Creston, British Columbia
Published September 4, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.

Mass Murderer Dies Alone in Prison Hospital
All the information for this article was gleaned from Canadian newspaper stories published from 1970 through 1971, and the report of the killer’s death published in 1999.
Overview
Dale Merle Nelson was a logger who liked to drink, do LSD and beat his wife Annette.
In early 1970 Nelson became depressed and attempted suicide. He spent two months at Riverview Provincial Mental Hospital in Coquitlam, BC.
Had he been successful, the eight innocent people he brutally murdered would have lived to see Christmas. That’s probably also true if he was just held longer at the lower mainland mental health facility.
But Dale Merle Nelson survived his suicide attempt and doctors at Riverview released him from the facility in January, 1970.
Then in June, Dale Nelson was convicted of assaulting his wife, but was sentenced to a year probation, not jail.
“We pleaded with the judge to send him back to Crease,” said Iris Herrick, Dale Nelson’s mother-in-law, referencing Riverview’s now-closed Crease Clinic.
On Friday, September 4, 1970, Dale Merle Nelson got drunk and, most likely, high on LSD, grabbed a 7mm Mauser 98k bolt action rifle he previously lent to a friend, and used it to murder eight people, including five children, in and around Creston, BC.
Iris Herrick didn’t ease anyone’s nerves after Dale Nelson was identified by RCMP as the suspect.
“I don’t think they’ll get him [alive] this time,” she said.
When asked if he would shoot it out with police, she replied, “Either that or he’ll do it himself.”
A six-man team with dogs found an unidentified man believed to be Dale Nelson sleeping behind the West Creston home of Dale Merle Nelson.
They radioed for help, and another nine RCMP units descended on the remote location where RCMP members surrounded the shack and the area behind it and ordered Dale Nelson to surrender.
“You are surrounded. Stand up, put your hands in the air and walk towards the cabin,” RCMP Superintendent Terrence Stewart said through a loudhailer.
Nelson did not respond.
“All units. Hold your fire.”
The command to come out was repeated a few times and the killer eventually said he would come out.
When he refused to get up off the ground where he lay, Constable Glen Manson sent his dog to subdue the killer.
Nelson got up to defend himself, but the dog threw him to the ground and police swarmed him.
At 5:05 pm on Sunday, September 6, 1970, Dale Merle Nelson was arrested and transported to the Creston RCMP detachment, where he was charged with one count of non-capital murder.
He would later be charged for killing all eight victims.
“He didn’t make any statements after we got him,” said RCMP Corporal James Barr, “but he did answer ‘yes’ to some of our questions.”
Those answers led investigators to the area where the mutilated body of 8-year-old Cathy Phipps was found.
It took 50 weary RCMP members and 3 RCMP dogs over 40 hours to locate and capture the mass murderer, which they did late Sunday afternoon on September 6, 1970.
No reason ever uncovered why Dale Merle Nelson killed and mutilated the bodies three adults and eight children.
Shirley Wasyk, 30;
Tracey Joan Wasyk, 8;
Raymond Phipps, 42;
Isobel St. Amand (Raymond’s common-law wife), 26;
Paul St. Amand, 10;
Catharine Rose St. Amand, 8;
Bryan St. Amand, 7;
Kenneth Phipps, 18 months.

The Two-Day Manhunt
Once the RCMP identified the man they were hunting, they put up road blocks and told area residents to lock their doors and not pick up hitchhikers.
RCMP released a description of Dale Merle Nelson, their only suspect, to the press and asked anyone with information about where Nelson was hiding to contact them.
Someone called police and reported an unidentified person moving along a ridge behind West Creston towards the area of Nelson’s home – about half way between the Phipps and Wasyk homes.
RCMP searchers were able to locate the person before dark.
A team of six RCMP members and a police dog stationed themselves on the south end of the ridge about Nelson’s home, but the killer managed to make it past the team sometime during the night.
On Sunday morning they discovered the plastic covering on the exterior of a window sliced open and what appeared to be evidence someone had hastily grabbed provisions.
The search parties were notified and the six-member team worked to pick up the killer’s trail.
While those RCMP members kept searching for Dale Nelson, another team of RCMP members escorted his wife Annette, to the Nelson home so she could grab some essentials for her and her three children.
While she was packing up what she needed, the team behind the house radioed that they found a man sleeping under a tree.
Annette Nelson was hastily escorted out of the house and back to Creston to where she and her children were staying.
When Dale Nelson refused get up off the ground, Constable Glen Manson sent his dog to subdue the suspect.
He got up as the dog attacked, but was no match for the trained canine. After the RCMP dog knocked him to the ground, a barefooted and unshaven Dale Merle Nelson was arrested without a struggle, ending the largest manhunt the area has ever seen.
What nobody knew then was almost two years later to the day, RCMP in the Kootenays would be on the hunt for another mass murderer, escaped mental patient William Bernard Lepine.
William Lepine escaped from Riverview Provincial Mental Hospital, the same institution where Dale Nelson spent two months, four times before going on his murder spree.

The First Horrific Murder Scene
At about 1am on September 5th, Maureen McKay, a neighour of the Wasyk family, was woken up by 12-year-old Debbie Wasyk, who said someone just killed her mother and sisters and was heading for the McKay home next.
When RCMP members arrived at the Wasyk home, they discovered the Shirley Wasyk’s body. She was beaten to death with a blunt object. They also discovered the body of 8-year-old Tracey Wasyk. She was stabbed multiple times.
Believing the murderer was on his way to the McKay residence, RCMP members closed the house and sped off to save the McKay family.
What they didn’t know was the murderer, Dale Merle Nelson, was still at the Wasyk residence.
When they returned some time later, the body of Tracey Wasyk was gone.
They eventually found the young girl’s decapitated, dismembered and mutilated body, with parts strewn over a 50-foot area about two miles away. An abandoned vehicle presumed to be used by the killer was nearby.
Alex Wasyk, husband of Shirley and father of Tracey, was away working at a logging camp at the time of the murders.
I can’t begin to imagine his heartbreak at learning his wife and young daughter were dead.

The Second Horrific Murder Scene
When RCMP members arrived at the Phipps home they discovered the bodies of six of the seven family members shot in the head, and their bodies mutilated.
Missing from the home was 8-year-old Cathy Phipps, who police believed was held hostage while he subdued and murdered the rest of the family.
One can only pray the young girl wasn’t forced to witness the slaughter and mutilation of her entire family.

Two Families Laid to Rest
On Wednesday, September 9, 1970, the murder victims from two families were put to rest in the Creston cemetery.
Separate funeral services were held for the Wasyk and Phipps families.
The RCMP escorted three coaches carrying the bodies of the Phipps family to the cemetery where there were buried.
United Church Minister Frank Baldock held a small, private service at a downtown funeral home. A tiny crowd gathered outside to pay there respects.
Five hours later, a similar service was held for Shirley Wasyk and her daughter Tracey at the Creston Legion Hall.

The Trial and the Jury’s Verdict
Dale Merle Nelson’s trial lasted ten days, but the outcome was all but guaranteed after Nelson’s defence attorney told the court his client had killed all eight victims.
During the trial, Crown counsel introduced a document describing the killing at the Wasyk house. That document described “certain unnatural acts with 8-year-old Charlene Wasyk” by Dale Nelson, and said he attempted to get Charlene to help him kill her sister Tracey.
In his closing arguments, Crown counsel T. G. Bowne-Cohurst suggested Nelson’s motive for the murders was his own perverse sexual gratification, saying Nelson murdered the adults so he could have his way with the little children.
On Friday, April 2, 1971, despite contradictory testimony about Nelson’s mental health, the jury of eight men and four women took only 80 minutes to return with a guilty verdict.

The Sentence
After hearing the jury’s verdict, Justice John Somerset Aikins asked Dale Merle Nelson to stand.
“Do you have anything to say?” Justice Aikins asked.
“No, your worship,” Nelson replied.
“I sentence you now to only penalty for non-capital murder – life in prison.”
The mass murderer gave no visible response.
Nelson was charged specifically with the murders of the two young girls, 7-year-old Tracey Joan Wasyk and 8-year-old Catharine Rose St. Armand.
During the trial, Nelson’s defence attorney told the court his client had killed all eight victims.
Nelson was eligible for parole in 1980, but was never released from prison.

Mass Murderer Dies Alone in Prison Hospital
On February 5, 1999, Dale Merle Nelson died of throat cancer in Matsqui Prison hospital, located outside Mission, B.C.

I have NEVER forgotten this horrifying slaughter. Creston is one hour from my hometown. As a teenager then, I was somewhat naive to the evil that existed and that it could be your next door neighbour.
In my Grade 11 law class, my classmate and I were assigned to go and sit, observe and take notes of the trial. We had attended a couple days, listened to opening statements, which were horrifying,  but one day was different.
We were seated right behind the witness box. When the little girl that survived took the stand, I remember thinking how pretty her dress was. It was a cream colour, with little pink and blue flowers. Her blondish hair was in braids. She sat straight and rigid, with her hands folded neatly in her lap. As the lawyers proceeded with their questions, (I don’t recall what they were) I remember looking at my friend and her looking at me, and we both knew we had to get out of that courthouse. I literally felt sick to my stomach. That girl was Cathy Phipps.
We went to our law teacher and told him we weren’t going to sit through that trial, and why. Thankfully he was very understanding, and gave us another project.
Over the years that little girl has crossed my mind quite often, and I have wondered how her life was afterwards. Was she able to find peace and happiness? I pray she did.

As a Phipps family member I can tell you you didn’t see Cathy at the trial. Cathy “Phipps” /St. Amond was murdered. Im assuming you mean Debbie Wasyk.
Our family lost touch with her years back. Hopefully she is doing well.

How could parole even be on the table, let alone after only 9 years, given the confession to 8 killings. The recurring trauma to the victims’ families and the possibility, however slim, of this evil being loosed upon the community, indicates how soft we have gone since capital punishment was abolished. The millions spent on feeding and housing this waste of skin for 28 years could have found more worthwhile application.

Great question, and one for which I wasn’t able to find the answer. I was similarly unable to locate any court documents on the case. The news stories of the day implied he applied for parole but was declined, but they weren’t clear.
Also, eligible to apply for parole is a far cry from being granted parole. For that, at least, we can be thankful.

I knew Dale when he lived in Gibsons Landing 1n 1969. He tried to kill me but no one, not even my husband believed me. I never went to the police. After all if my friends and family wouldn’t believe me why would the police.
I was only 17, and was afraid if Dale found I went to the police he would surely try to kill me again.
The day I met Dale, I had my back to him and when he walked through the door my hair stood up on end. That night I told the person that introduced me to him that he was going to kill someone someday.  That was the day two months of terror began. It was like yesterday, I should have gone to the police but I was afraid.
The day after Dale committed the unimaginable, horrific murders the Gibbons RCMP called me in Victoria BC because all these people told the police that I kept telling them Dale would kills someone someday and that he stalked me and that I knew it was Dale that offered money to a little girl if she would pull down her pants but I was to scared to come forward.
They (the police) said they were all dead because of me. I still live this hellish nightmare of guilt.
I often wonder if I would have been his first victim or were there more before me or before the mass murders. It wasn’t just out of the blue. He showed signs way before he took their lives. Only everyone I knew seemed to like Dale and repeatedly said he was harmless, and thought there was something wrong with me for saying he was going to kill someone and then telling them he tried to kill me, and that it was him that was offering kids money. People thought for some reason I had it out for him. My phone didn’t stop ringing for days after the mass murders, everyone saying how did you know. I just knew…

That’s a pretty nasty guilt trip for the police  to lay on you. If nobody in your life would listen to you, I fail to see why the police would have believed you until it was too late.
Nobody goes on a mass murder spree without some signs beforehand.  Those signs are always ignored because, like your family members, nobody wants to believe someone they know is capable of this sort of evil.
The guilt is not yours. That much I’m sure of. Maybe your family members, those who refused to believe you, ought to bear that guilt instead.

There were other unseen victims as well. Many of the RCMP members who had to deal with the aftermath ended up very ill with PTSD. My father was the primary officer in charge of the investigation, and unfortunately became one of those victims who then spent many years as a very unwell man. His well prepared case ensured that Nelson was convicted. May he now R.I.P.

So very true, Donald, and I’m sorry your father suffered as a result of this crime, and your family as well. The ripple effect of these monsters’s crimes go far beyond the immediate family members, as you note so sadly and so well.

Isabel was my mother’s sister.. My father and mother were asked to identify the bodies.. My parents left on September 4 to do this., It was my birthday and they vanished. I was four turning five.. It was finally revealed on my 14th birthday what had happened. My Grandma was visiting our home. Dad and her were discussing the possibility of Nelson getting parole one day.  It was an upsetting time for the family.. I finally asked my Dad if I was allowed to know more.. My Grandma and Dad agreed to tell me the story.. My father told me everything. I was horrified.. Looking back I can easily see that they both suffered PTSD for ever..My Father was in the military. Even he could not handle what he saw. He told me,Nelson shot the whole family with a sawed off shotgun,, except for Cathy.. Dad told me she was kidnapped by Nelson and then killed in the forest. To this day I cry on my birthday and I talk to my cousin, up above, who I only met once..

I first heard of this c. 1973 by family members who moved to neighboring Wynndel in 1969. The details of the murders were beyond horrific &amp; I always think of it whenever passing through or visiting Creston.
May the victims and their families be at peace.

Escaped Mental Patient William Bernard Lepine and the 1972 Kettle Valley Murders
Published August 27, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.

On July 6, 1972, William Bernard Lepine aka William McConnell, an escapee from the Riverview Provincial Mental Hospital in Coquitlam, was recaptured after a high-speed car chase down British Columbia’s Highway 3.
It was his third escape from the facility since he was first committed earlier that year.
He was taken to hospital in Creston, BC, after his vehicle crashed with minor cuts.
His destination was the Dr. Endicott Home for the retarded, where Lepine had at one time been employed.
Lepine’s mission, according to former staff members at the Home, was to save the children from nuclear war, which he believed was imminent. How he would save the children or where he would take them to keep them safe remains a mystery locked inside the madman’s mind.
After his release from hospital in Creston, Lepine was returned to Riverview Provincial Mental Hospital.
On July 30, 1972, William Lepine escaped from Riverview a fourth time, and an arrest warrant was issued for the escaped psychiatric patient.
While he was free, William Lepine murdered six people in the Kettle Valley and the Kootenays:
Lee Willard Potter – 16 – of Oliver, BC
Charles Christopher Wright – 71 – of Oliver, BC
Phyllis Clarke – 61 – of Penticton, BC
Herbert Evan Thomas – 57 – of Rock Creek, BC
Nellie Thomas – 56 – of Rock Creek, BC
Thomas John Pozney – 24 – of Nakusp, BC
The bodies of Lee Willard Potter and Charles Wright were recovered on the Kettle Valley Road near the Damfino Creek campsite after they disappeared from the Oliver-area orchard where they worked on August 28, 1972.
Phyllis Clark was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital in Trail, BC. Three others, including Phyllis Clark’s husband, were wounded during the killing spree.
Herbert and Nellie Thomas were found dead in near Edgewood, BC, and Thomas Pozney was found shot to death while fishing on Arrow Lake.
Roughly 25 RCMP members took part in the manhunt after the first bodies were discovered, and they followed a trail that led over 150 miles from the Kettle Valley to Galena Bay, on Upper Arrow Lake.
There, RCMP members captured the killer, who had a .22 calibre pistol and a .30 calibre rifle in his possession.
Where and how William Lepine obtained the guns he used to murder six innocent people is unknown.
Initially remanded to the Riverview Hospital on a 30-day evaluation, on September 3, 1972, William Bernard Lepine was committed to the psychiatric facility until fit to stand trial on the authority of a provincial cabinet Order in Council.
In an article titled “The menace of madness” published in The Province on September 30, 1972, reporter Tony Eberts described what Lepine told fellow workers at the Dr. Endicott Home for the retarded before he was fired from the institution.
Last July, William Lepine had a mission: To somehow save 30 retarded children in an interior B.C. institution from the nuclear war he believed was coming.
Today he is in the maximum-security section of Riverview Provincial Mental Hospital, charged with murdering six persons – one of them a 16-year-old youth.
The question of why may be locked forever in a world of madness. But there is also the question of whether the deadly rampage could have been prevented.
According to a police officer involved in the case, Lepine escaped from Riverview four times during the summer [of 1972].
According to hospital spokesmen, he escaped three times, on the last occasion breaking away from two staff members, leaping a six-foot-high wire fence and crossing a busy highway.
Dr. F.G. Tucker, deputy minister of mental health services, ordered an inquiry into the Lepine case, conducted by members of his department in Victoria. He said the “internal” inquiry was as far as he could go as deputy minister; because of the provincial election there was no minister functioning at the time.
The committee’s report has been submitted to Tucker, who told The Provice that Dennis Cocke, newly-appointed health minister in the Barret government, has seen it.
It will not be made public, Tucker said.
Outrage at the murders by an escaped mental patient sparked calls for greater security at institutions like Riverview Provincial Mental Hospital. Those calls went unheeded.
In July 2012, Riverview was closed. Plans to replace obsolete buildings were never implemented.
Today, Riverview is used primarily as a location studio for Vancouver-based film and television productions.

Riverview… St Paul’s … Eric Martin… and other psych units, when they were shut down after Gorden Campbell/ Christy Clark et al  declared that “BC is open for business” and he/they Liberals also sold off youth correctional camps for profit and real estate [ e.g. Robert’s Lake ], well, all went to hell. He also declared war upon health care workers and tore up contracts and rolled back wages
We saw in our LTC/dementia units a surge of mental psych patients placed into residential units some very violent people from those aforementioned closed facilities. People that went on to severely assault resident and staff in manners of attacks i cannot mention here, WCB did not cover most incidents of these assaults nor investigate onsite hot-spots [ Campbell also ‘restructured’ WCB to make things harder for us health workers]
PTSD claims and such were in it’s infancy compared to now-a-days so not it wasn’t recognized.
I have several intrusive memories of those days and of those responsible for the harms done to our residents and families. These incidents make victims of the survivors and witnesses and recourse is still a pipe dream for most… if any here read contemporary news you’d be astonished that G.Campbell is currently facing  and delaying charges/legal issues due to sexual harassment complaints during his Hydro posting and High Commissioner posting after his leave from politics. He was known to yell and scream and belittle his own female MLAs .
These people were highly responsible for allowing the vulnerable of society to face harm from violent mental health issue patients released or transferred.
And you know… I do not believe in Karma, Bad stuff seems to happen all the time to good innocent caring people.

An April 30, 2008, story in the Vancouver Sun said, “Now in his early 60s, William Bernard Lepine remains in the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital in Port Coquitlam.”
Best as I can tell, he is still alive and still incarcerated there.

The Blue Bird Café fire was a nightclub fire on September 1, 1972, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In all, 37 people were killed as a result of arson.[1][2]
The fire was the worst in Montreal since 1927, when 77 people perished in the Laurier Palace Theatre Fire.[3] It is also the worst and only nightclub fire casualty in Canadian history.
Venue[edit]
Montreal’s Blue Bird Café and the Wagon Wheel, a country and western bar above it, were located on the west side of Union Street between Ste-Catherine Ouest and Dorchester (now René-Lévesque) in downtown Montreal, lying within the borough of Ville-Marie.[2] The café and bar were known as places where largely working-class, English-speaking youth[2] could come for an evening of music, dancing, and drinking.[1]
Fire[edit]
There was lots of pitch black smoke and then a lot of heat and a lot of yellow light ... We knew it was a fire. Everyone began to panic.
George Lancia, survivor[3]
On the evening of Friday, September 1, 1972, the beginning of the Labour Day weekend, more than 200 people were at the bar celebrating.[2] Around 10:45 PM, three young men (initial reports said four)[3] were refused entry to the upstairs bar, as they appeared excessively intoxicated.  Upset by this, Gilles Eccles, James O’Brien and Jean-Marc Boutin set a fire on the staircase that served as the only regular entrance or exit for the Wagon Wheel&#39;s customers.[1] &#34;It was either a Molotov cocktail or gasoline spread on the stairs and then ignited,&#34; said Montreal Police Inspector Armand Chaille.  The entire bar was in flames within a few minutes, according to police.[3]
With the primary escape route blocked by the fire advancing upward toward the crowded[3] bar, its patrons sought out other exits. However, conflicting city building codes and fire regulations had left the upstairs bar with too few fire exits for its capacity of patrons. With the bar&#39;s main exit aflame and its sole fire exit blocked,[2] patrons were forced to use one of two escape routes: either through the kitchen onto a folding fire escape (the emergency exit was chained) or by climbing through a window in the women&#39;s restroom and dropping some 20 feet onto a parked car.[1]
At its peak, the fire was fought by more than 50 firefighters.  Five firefighters would be injured by smoke inhalation before the fire was declared out.[3]  At the time, the wearing of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) was a relatively new practice and not as common among firefighters as it is today. The fire was brought under control by 2:30 a.m., and extinguished by daybreak.
Victims[edit]
While it was originally reported that 42 people had died,[3] later investigation determined that 37 people succumbed and perished as smoke and fire overtook the bar.[1] Police and firefighters found bodies in the bathrooms, huddled in a corner that had no exit, and jammed in a rear section of the club close to a back entrance.[3]
Aftermath[edit]
At 3:30 a.m. Eccles was arrested and a manhunt was on for Boutin and O&#39;Brien.[4] They were arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia two weeks later.[5]
In the aftermath of the fire, regulations throughout Canada were strengthened to provide for more avenues of escape.[1]  Two of the three defendants were convicted of second-degree murder, the third manslaughter. All three were paroled within a decade of their convictions.[6][7] Owing to the blocked fire exit, a lawyer for the victims&#39; families proposed a $9 million civil lawsuit against the Montreal fire department, bar owner Leopold Paré, and the building&#39;s owner, with the defence led by Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau.  The families eventually accepted a much lower settlement offer of $1,000 to $3,000 per victim.[2]  Memorial on Phillips Square

On August 31, 2012, a memorial was unveiled by the city of Montreal to mark the 40th anniversary. A mass was held as well as a march by families of the victims along with a photo exhibit at city hall, with a vigil on September 1.[7] As of May 2022 the memorial has been installed at the south side of Phillips Square following the renovation of the square. A 50th anniversary memorial is planned for September 1, 2022.

The Brampton Centennial Secondary School shooting was a school shooting that occurred at Brampton Centennial Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario, Canada on Wednesday, May 28, 1975, at 11:35 a.m. The school closed for the remainder of the week following the shooting, and re-opened the following Monday.
Shooting[edit]
Michael Slobodian, a 16-year-old student at the school, had been cutting classes, and teacher Margaret Wright had called his parents to inform them of the issue.[1] His mother confronted Slobodian about this during a mid-morning break, when Slobodian had gone home. Slobodian then wrote a note to his family, including &#34;I am going to eliminate certain people from this world. Those people are: Mrs. Wright, Mr. Bronson and any other sucker who gets in my way. I am then going to kill myself so as not to be imprisoned.&#34;[1] Ross Bronson was a physics teacher who had recently vetoed one of Slobodian&#39;s entries in a science fair. He wanted to get revenge because he hated the school system.[2]
Slobodian returned to school with two rifles in a guitar case.[3][4] He began by firing at three boys in a washroom, killing fellow student John Slinger and wounding the other two.[1] He then entered the hallway and continued shooting, wounding several students. He proceeded to an art classroom, killed Wright and wounded two more students. He returned to the hallway and killed himself, adjacent to the art classroom. In addition to the three dead (including himself), Slobodian had wounded 13 others.[2]
Witnesses of the shooting included students Cathy and Nancy Davis, the daughters of then Ontario Premier William Davis. Another witness of the shooting was Scott Thompson, of The Kids in the Hall fame, who was in the same English class with Slobodian that was taught by Wright.[5]  Thompson has stated that the 24-year-old Wright, who was six months pregnant, had been his favourite teacher and the first person to encourage his writing talents.[5]

Students filed in at the bell, but the beginning of the day was eerily quiet at Brampton Centennial Secondary School. As classes got underway, the voice of principal William Springle came over the public address system: “In this earthly existence,” he said, “we may never unravel the mystery that led to the tragedy that befell us last week.” Then normal activities resumed.The previous Wednesday — May 28, 1975 — 16-year-old Michael Slobodian walked into the high school carrying two rifles in a black guitar case. Within five minutes, Slobodian had killed two people and wounded 13 more. He then shot himself fatally in the head with a .444-calibre bullet. The attack left Brampton stunned. Apart from Springle’s speech, there was little official recognition of what had happened in the months and years to come. Many coped with the trauma in silence. For 40 years, Slobodian’s rampage rippled through the lives of people who were there that day, leaving scars and steering fates. Some wrote songs about it, others wrote plays. Some chose their careers because of it, others their homes. Many say they suffered post-traumatic stress. Others say they emerged from the tragedy stronger. It was just the second high school shooting in Canadian history, and it remains the bloodiest.On Thursday, May 28, many of these people will gather at Centennial for a memorial ceremony. “A lot of us have never even spoken about it in 40 years,” said Pam Hand, who as a Grade 9 student watched in horror while Michael Slobodian put a rifle to his head and pulled the trigger. “There’s a lot of people who need to do a lot of healing.”Today, the tragic pattern of school shootings is familiar. Columbine may be the most famous, but at least a half-dozen more have become bywords in the last 30 years: Dawson College, École Polytechnique, Concordia, C.W. Jefferys, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook.But in 1975, and in Brampton — then still many years shy of its expansion into a suburban boomtown — bloodshed in school hallways was virtually unheard of. Newspaper accounts from the time, and a dozen Star interviews with former students this year, reveal a community totally unprepared to cope with tragedy and trauma on the scale wrought by Slobodian’s rampage. May 28 began inauspiciously in the Toronto suburb: blue skies, kids playing hooky. Michael’s English teacher Margaret Wright called home to say he had been cutting class. When he arrived at the family’s bungalow around 10:40 for the mid-morning recess, his mother confronted him about his absences. This is the only explanation he offered for what he was about to do: “To Whom It May Concern,” his suicide note began, written in a looping, boyish hand. “My life is now gone to pot. I am going to eliminate certain people from this world. Those people are: Mrs. Wright, Mr. Bronson and any other sucker who gets in my way. I am then going to kill myself so as not to be imprisoned. I am not insane but just strictly fed up with life. I am not getting anywhere and it’s my fault. I love my parents and my family and I know that they love me. Michael Peter Slobodian.” The killing began in the boys’ washroom. Slobodian loaded his rifles, a .22-calibre semi-automatic and a .444-calibre lever-action, in a toilet stall. Wearing a green beret, he stepped out and shot three students: Michael Gibeault, 19, Richard Shadrach, 16, and John Slinger, 17. Slinger would not survive. Then Slobodian stepped into the hallway. Lunch break had just begun. Michael began firing wildly. Many couldn’t believe what was happening. Grade 10 student Sylvia Meister thought Slobodian and his rifles were part of a history lesson at first. Pam Read — now Pam Hand — thought she was witnessing the filming of a commercial. Maureen Abraham — now Maureen Sim — thought someone was setting off cherry bombs. Reality quickly sunk in: the school’s first floor grew thick with gun smoke and the sound of students screaming. Neil Bristol was standing in the school’s smoking area outside when people came running through the doors, yelling about someone with a gun Slobodian saw Mrs. Wright, the English teacher, in a doorway — one of his targets. (Michael never reached his other target, science teacher Ross Bronson.) According to reports, she said his name — “Michael” — before he shot her in the chest. Wright would die in hospital. Then, from down the hall, through a haze of smoke, Pam Read saw Slobodian put a rifle to his head. A forensic assessment later found that he died from “massive destruction of the brain.”A teacher pulled Scott Thompson, now of Kids in the Hall fame, into a classroom during the shooting. Inside, huddled students plotted to stab any attacker with protractors. Others tried, unsuccessfully, to break windows with chairs. Rumours circulated of more shooters, as many as three, one on each floor. Police finally told him it was safe to go, more than half an hour after Slobodian killed himself. Thompson remembers students walking in an orderly single file and police telling them not to look left — where Michael’s body was. Thompson and Slobodian lived on the same street and had known each other since childhood. Outside, students took off running or collapsed on the lawn. A cadre of mothers stood anxiously around the front entrance in housecoats and pyjamas. They had heard the news on the radio. Thompson says he was in shock; adrenalin made the world cartoonishly vivid. “Everything is so sharp and vibrating … sounds are so crisp … you’re alive in a way that you’re not normally,” he said. Disoriented, he didn’t go home immediately. When Thompson finally arrived at his front door, his mother was furious. “‘Where the hell were you?’” she said. “‘Why didn’t you call?’” The next day, when he came down the stairs for breakfast, his mother was reading the newspaper. “For the first time, it became real. I remember sitting with my mother and crying.” It would be a rare moment of catharsis. Thompson, like most of the dozen former students interviewed for this story, found their parents and teachers reluctant to discuss the tragedy, wary of “dwelling on it,” keen to move on. “No one had the words,” said Thompson. “No one had the experience.”Brenda Weitendorf was injured by shrapnel after a bullet struck a wall behind her. The shot came so close that she also received gunpowder burns. “They didn’t know about PTSD,” she said. “We got no help. It was almost this taboo thing.” Sylvia Meister’s left arm was grazed by a bullet in the shooting. Her psychological wounds were much more serious. For years, she says she kept that suffering to herself. “I was in desperate emotional pain. But I, for some reason, didn’t want to put a voice to it,” she said. “I don’t know if it was discouraged. I just don’t know if it was encouraged, which sometimes has the same result.” The attempt to soldier on began at school. “We were preparing for exams and marks, so students came back even though they had a fearful feeling about the school,” said Springle, the principal, reached this week at his home in Erin. There had been some cleanup over the weekend, but the building still bore physical marks of Slobodian’s attack. Thompson remembers there was still blood behind a water tank in the boys’ washroom.Sylvia Meister noticed the hole in the wall created by the bullet that grazed her arm. Several students found Margaret Wright’s classroom especially chilling. “We tried to go in that day,” said Tracy Reid (née Burt). “But it was really an eerie, cold feeling, and we left.”Few people laughed or raised their voices that first Monday, Pam Hand recalled. “I remember just thinking, ‘It’s so quiet. It’s so, so quiet.’” As the shock wore off, the silence persisted. Neither the school nor police offered counselling for students who had witnessed the killing. “I don’t think it was the fault of anyone in particular — that’s just the way it was,” said Lorna McCluskey, who hid in an art supply closet during the shooting. “I guess they thought if we dwelled on it, we would get all depressed.” Part of the problem in discussing what happened is that it was, and remains, so inexplicable. Slobodian had no obvious mental health problems, no pressing grievances with other students. There were a handful of faint “warning signs” — he was “quiet”; he joined the local militia in April; he didn’t have many close friends; he dabbled in weed and LSD; he was a keen hunter. In what is perhaps the strangest omen, Slobodian was working on a biology project that was rejected for the science fair because it involved killing frogs, removing their hearts, and then resurrecting the animals by applying electrical shocks to the organs.Still, many people eventually recognized his sudden eruption for what it was: a mystery.“I’ve stopped asking myself why he did it,” said Dean Nadon, a student wounded by Slobodian, in a January 1977 interview with the Star. “I’ve come to accept the fact that there are some questions which have no answers.” With or without an explanation, many former students can’t help reliving the shooting to this day. Scott Gibbons, who carried a wounded female student to the nurse’s office during the attack, has flashbacks whenever he sees a massacre on the TV news. “It’s visceral,” he said. “You just get that feeling. You just know what it’s like … It’s like when somebody pulls a knife on you — everything goes quiet real fast.”Sylvia Meister still gets frightened by loud noises. “I’m quite sure I had PTSD for years,” she said. “I probably just in the last 10 years have gotten past that. But even talking about it now, it’s difficult.” Scott Thompson still can’t be in a room with balloons — the sound their popping makes is too close to the pop-pop-pop of Michael Slobodian’s .22-calibre rifle. For some, the memories were too sharp, too painful. Pat Slinger was studying as a mature student at Centennial in 1975. She rushed into Mrs. Wright’s class, Rm. 104, when the shooting started. There she found the teacher with a large chest wound that she couldn’t cover with her hand, she later told the coroner’s inquest. Slinger didn’t know that her son John was bleeding to death in the boys’ washroom. In the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, the Slingers lobbied publicly for tighter gun controls. But according to a 2008 death notice published in the Globe, the family moved to Alberta in 1976, “haunted” by the killing. For her part, Brenda Weitendorf transferred to a high school in Mississauga after the attack. Forty years later, she still hasn’t been back to Brampton Centennial. Weitendorf was willing to talk about her experience. Many others were eager, details spilling out in a flood of bottled-up talk. But for some, especially those with serious physical injuries, the thought of an interview was too painful. Dean Nadon begged off. The bullet that killed Mrs. Wright passed through her body and hit him in the hip before lodging near his spine. He very politely said he didn’t feel up to discussing it. When Slobodian emerged from the bathroom stall with bandoliers of bullets making an “X” across his chest, Michael Gibeault was the first to see him. In 2012, he posted to a Facebook page for people affected by the shooting and described how he took three bullets to the stomach and one to the arm. Decades later, when he was diagnosed with cancer, doctors determined that lead from those bullets was still in his body and contributing to the illness. Gibeault died in 2013. It can seem insensitive to look for a silver lining in so much tragedy. Some former students felt it was perverse to attribute any good to the shooting that killed Mrs. Wright and hobbled Ernie Nicholls. But others reluctantly acknowledged that living through trauma changed their lives for the better, in oblique but powerful ways. Twenty years after his pal John Slinger was killed, Brampton musician Bruce Madole finally sat down and wrote a song about what happened. “After The Shooting Stops” is about hard-learned lessons. “I never knew what friends were for until one of mine lay dying,” he sings. Scott Thompson also channelled the misery of that day. In 1999, on the night of the Columbine shooting, Mrs. Wright appeared to him in a dream and told him to make art out of the tragedy. “She came to me and said ‘I want you to dance with my bones.’”Thompson has since penned a darkly comedic screenplay about a suburban school shooting. “It’s like the worst day of my life, but in some ways it was the best, because I made it through,” he now says. Others took more direct and practical inspiration from the attack, becoming nurses or cops. Derrick Goobie, a Centennial student in 1975, now works in the Emergency Task Force of the Toronto Police Service, and teaches others how to react to school shootings. “A lot of times when I’m lecturing, I bring this up, that I was involved with this, and this is what it was like in ’75 and this is what we’re striving to be like today,” he said. Forty years ago, the students of Brampton Centennial anticipated that the worst day of their lives might be transformed into something other than sheer horror. The 1975 BCSS yearbook contains some accidentally disturbing moments, like John Slinger and Michael Slobodian alphabetically adjacent to each other in the gallery of headshots. But the first page carries a message of hope, next to the image of a Canadian flag at half-mast: “On Wednesday May 28, 1975, all of us learned to love one another just a little bit more.” SHARE:Report an errorJournalistic StandardsAbout The StarJOIN THE CONVERSATION Q:Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder.
