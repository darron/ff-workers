Saanich, B.C., bank shooting motive may never be known, says criminologist
Vancouver Island
Saanich, B.C., bank shooting motive may never be known, says criminologist
Questions of what would motivate twin brothers to enter a British Columbia bank dressed in body armour and prepared for a gun battle remain unanswered, but a criminologist sees similarities to two other young men who terrified Canadians in 2019.
Prof. Robert Gordon from Simon Fraser University&#39;s school of criminology said there are parallels with the Saanich bank shootout last week and the murders of three people in B.C. and the subsequent suicides of their killers.
A manhunt for Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, and Kam McLeod, 19, lasted nearly a month in the summer of 2019 before they were found dead in northern Manitoba.
Twenty-two-year-old Mathew and Isaac Auchterlonie of Duncan, B.C., were killed by police in a shootout that left six officers injured outside a Bank of Montreal branch in Saanich on June 28.
Police have said the men also had explosive devices in their vehicle.
“There&#39;s a bigger issue here, and I find it kind of fascinating, is the infectious nature of some of this stuff,” Gordon said in an interview.
The minds of men who are drawn to firearms and not doing “very well” in life are intriguing, he said, noting the failed application of one of the twins to join the armed forces.
“What gets into the minds of these young men is beyond belief.”
A statement from the Canadian Armed Forces said Mathew Auchterlonie had applied to be part of the military but didn&#39;t pass the aptitude test.
Isaac Auchterlonie participated in the Soldier for a Day program in 2018, it said.
“As the name implies, the program lasts one day, and participants are provided a certificate at the end as a keepsake,” it said. &#34;It&#39;s not a training activity, but more of a simple “open house”, and often a type of field trip for high school classes.“
Neither man has ever been part of the Canadian Armed Forces in any way, it added.
Three officers remain in hospital, including one who is in intensive care after three surgeries.
A classmate of the twins described the men as “shy and quiet.”
Courtney Dougan lives in Cobble Hill and attended Frances Kelsey Secondary School in Mill Bay, B.C., with the twins.
“I was not friends with the Auchterlonie brothers,” she said. “They were very to themselves. I mainly saw them in passing through halls or in classrooms. They were very nice kids.”
Having gone to school with two men now involved in a bank shootout is “very weird and strange,” she said.
“We&#39;re all very shocked still. It&#39;s a very tight community around here,” Dougan said. “(I&#39;m) just very surprised and just feel awful for the family going through this.”
Gordon called the bank robbery and subsequent shootout a “tragedy of wasted life, wasted talent.”
“Because they get caught up in some bizarre mixture of entertainment and news, and decide to create their own reality.”
Comparisons have been made to the shootout with the North Hollywood Bank of America robbery in 1997 where two robbers were killed in a hail of gunfire.
Gordon said some police departments use footage from that shootout for training purposes to understand what went wrong and what was done right.
The main issue of that robbery was the heavy firepower used by the robbers while the police were not that well-armed, he noted.
“What happened a week ago in Victoria, bears some similarity in that it was a small, suburban bank that was attacked,” he said.
“But the guys who were involved with the North Hollywood bank robbery, were older men, experienced men who had done crimes before and who were carrying a lot of really serious firepower.”
Saanich Police Chief Const. Dean Duthie said he is not aware if the Greater Victoria Emergency Response Team has viewed the North Hollywood robbery video.
“But I know that the training, the research and the connections to ensure that they are prepared for the most dangerous situations is something that they do.”
The emergency response team was in the area last Tuesday on another matter and changed course to immediately respond to the robbery call at the bank, police have said.
Gordon said he understands that there are a number of questions about what happened last week, and people might look to that old shooting for answers. But these would be questions police and the Independent Investigations Office have on their list as well, he added.
“And foremost is, what kinds of firearms were being used.”
RCMP spokesman Cpl. Alex Berube said investigators have made some initial evaluations about the weapons used by the twins, but further analysis is needed.
“We are not in a position at this time to provide further specifics,” he said in an email.
Police have not been able to establish a motive either, Berube said.
“Every investigation has theories and investigators need to gather information and evidence and ultimately eliminate or confirm those theories or even follow the evidence to other possibilities.”
Gordon said the true motive of the armed bank robbery by the twins may never be known.
“Usually the motive is cash. That&#39;s the purpose of a robbery. You&#39;re not doing it for any other reason,” he said.
“So, they were probably out to get some quick and easy money. And or do it with a bit of excitement. Usually people who rob banks, there aren&#39;t that many of them anymore, do it purely for the cash. It&#39;s a question with an obvious answer, in many respects.”
This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 6, 2022.

On June 28, 2022, a shootout occurred between two gunmen and responding police officers following a robbery of a Bank of Montreal branch in Saanich, British Columbia, Canada. Both gunmen, later identified as twin brothers Mathew and Isaac Auchterlonie, were killed by police, while six officers were injured, three of them severely.
Following an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, it was alleged that the robbery had been staged as a means of drawing police officers into an armed confrontation. The Auchterlonie brothers had been motived by anti-police sentiment and an opposition to government firearms legislation. The bank was selected at random by the brothers after they abandoned a larger attack planned for 2023.[1][2]
Events[edit]
Police responded to reports of armed suspects at a Bank of Montreal branch in Saanich at around 11:00 a.m.[3] At the time of the robbery, approximately 22 people were inside the bank, most of them employees.
A witness described hearing an explosion before the robbery started. She also described the perpetrators as remaining calm throughout the robbery, wearing balaclavas and all-black clothing with armored vests, and being armed with what appeared to be assault rifles.[4] The rifles were later confirmed to be semi-automatic SKS rifles.[2]
The gunmen proceeded to move bank employees and customers into the back vault area. After acquiring cash from the bank manager, the gunmen remained inside the bank.[5] They were observed to have been pacing back-and-forth between areas of the bank while inspecting the parking lot from the vestibule window.[6]
Officers belonging to the Greater Victoria Emergency Response Team (GVERT), an integrated police unit designed to respond to high-risk incidents, were nearby on an unrelated call and moved to respond to the robbery.[2][5] Members of the Saanich Police Department and the GVERT both arrived on scene.[6]
After spending 16 minutes inside the bank, the gunmen proceeded to exit the bank into the parking lot. As they left the vestibule, one of the gunmen observed an approaching unmarked GVERT van and raised his rifle. An officer inside of the van deployed a flashbang explosive as the van passed by the gunmen.[6]
A shootout ensued between the gunmen and officers located inside of the van. Nearby officers in the parking lot also returned fire.[6] Both perpetrators were killed and six police officers were injured in the gunfire.[5][7]
Witnesses reported hearing 15–50 gunshots. The road was later closed off, and nearby homes and businesses were evacuated due to a possible explosive found in a vehicle belonging to the robbers.[8] At around 1:30 p.m., a shelter-in-place order was issued; it was lifted at around 6:00.[3] Police later confirmed that 4 additional firearms, 3500 rounds of ammunition, and more than 30 improvised explosive devices were located inside the vehicle.[9][2] They also investigated the possibility of a third suspect involved in the shootout,[10] but it was later determined that there were only two suspects.[1]
Victims[edit]
The six injured police officers all belonged to the Greater Victoria Emergency Response Team, and comprised three Saanich Police Department officers and three Victoria Police Department officers.[3] Three of the injured sustained &#34;life-threatening&#34; injuries and underwent surgery, with one of them remaining in intensive care. The other three injured officers were discharged from the hospital.[10] No civilians were injured during the incident.[3]
Investigation[edit]
Police said that they believed the perpetrators were both wearing body armour and that the shootout started outside the bank, although it was unclear who fired first.[11] The RCMP&#39;s Vancouver Island Integrated Major Crime Unit took over the investigation and treated the incident as an attempted murder.[10] During a press conference on July 2, RCMP identified the suspects as twin brothers Mathew and Isaac Auchterlonie from Duncan; neither had a criminal record nor were previously known to police. A now-deleted Instagram account belonging to Isaac Auchterlonie featured several posts with anti-government hashtags and posts about the North Hollywood shootout.[12][13]
In January 2023, the RCMP announced that the alleged motive for the robbery and shootout was &#34;anti-police&#34; and &#34;anti-government&#34; sentiments. Alex Bérubé of the RCMP&#39;s Vancouver Island Integrated Major Crime Unit alleged that the intention of the Auchterlonie brothers was &#34;to shoot and kill police officers in what they saw as a stand against government regulations, especially in relation to firearms ownership&#34;.[1] Police confirmed that they did not believe the brothers were motivated by money or that they intended to harm civilians.[2]
Investigation by the RCMP determined that Mathew and Isaac Auchterlonie had allegedly been planning an attack on law enforcement since 2019. The duo had been stockpiling firearms and explosives in preparation for an attack they had planned to occur in mid-2023. However, the brothers abandoned their initial plan due to fears that an upcoming move out of their house would draw attention to their weapons. The brothers instead decided to stage a bank robbery for the purposes of provoking an armed police response and selected the Bank of Montreal branch in Saanich at random.[2]
Responses[edit]
The Saanich Police Association and the Victoria City Police Union started an online fundraising campaign for the injured officers.[14] The campaign raised $277,752.
The interim chief of police of the Toronto Police Service, James Ramer, posted on Twitter that &#34;[they] stand with [the officers&#39;] families and hope for the full recovery of each officer.&#34;[15]
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also expressed on Twitter that he was &#34;shocked and saddened by the violence&#34; and that &#34;[he is] keeping the police officers who were injured – and their colleagues who also rushed towards danger to keep people safe – in [his] thoughts.&#34;[16]

Eric WelshJul. 21, 2022 9:40 p.m.Local NewsNews
The suspect in a triple-shooting in Chilliwack is on the run and considered armed and dangerous.
Eric John Shestalo, 50, has been identified as the alleged shooter by the RCMP’s Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT).
“Officers are working to locate Mr. Shestalo as well as any witnesses to this devastating incident.” said IHIT Sgt. Timothy Pierotti.
Around 11 a.m. Thursday morning (July 21), two women and one man were shot at a home in the 9700-block of McNaught Road. One of the woman died at the scene. The other woman was airlifted to Royal Columbian Hospital where she later died. The man suffered non-life threatening injuries.

Anyone who sees Shestalo is urged to not approach him, and phone 911 immediately.
