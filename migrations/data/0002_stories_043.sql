Angelica was a student at Seneca College. (Toronto Police Service handout)Police have identified two women fatally stabbed in North York on Friday afternoon, alleging the man who killed them was a family member.Elvie Sig-Od, 44, and Angelica Sig-Od, 20, both from Toronto, were killed inside a vehicle near  Bathurst Street and Ellerslie Avenue after what police say was an &#34;obvious struggle.&#34;A 46-year-old man, Godfrey Sig-Od, is now facing second-degree murder charges. He appeared in court on Saturday.Police say all three were injured in the incident, but it was the two women who died at the scene. Harmy Mendoza, executive director of Woman Abuse Council of Toronto, told CBC News she was saddened but not surprised to hear the alleged perpetrator was a family member, saying femicides are often carried out by former or existing intimate partners or family members.&#34;I would call it a crisis,&#34; she said. &#34;Not only do we need to be concerned, we need to be doing something about it.&#34;Ontario sees an average of three femicides per month, Mendoza says.In 2020 there were 36 femicides in the province, she said. In 2021, that number jumped to 54. There have been more than 27 femicides reported in Ontario since November 2021, Mendoza says. In 12 of those cases, the perpetrator was an intimate partner and in five, it was a family member, she said.&#39;She had an effect on everyone she met&#39;Daniel Levy was a close friend of Angelica&#39;s and said he was filled with &#34;emptiness, sadness and anger&#34; upon hearing of her death.Levy first met Angelica in 2016 after she&#39;d been brought in to help out at a bakery at the summer camp where his father, a caterer, worked in Gravenhurst, Ont.The two became fast friends, spending time together after work, watching the sunset, laughing and lifting each other up during hard times, he said.&#34;Very caring, loving, and supportive&#34; are the words that comes to mind when he recalls Angelica.&#34;She had an effect on everyone she met,&#34; he said.Angelica looked up to her mother a lot, Levy recalled. He&#39;d met Elvie only a few times, but remembers her as &#34;very sweet.&#34;Toronto police arrested the man after the stabbing incident on Friday. Charges were laid the following day. (Alexis Raymon/CBC)Fundraiser launched to send bodies to Philippines Seneca College, where Angelica was a student, released a statement shortly after she was identified as one of the two victims.&#34;The Seneca community is deeply saddened by the sudden death of student Angelica Sid-Od,&#34; the statement read.&#34;Our thoughts are with Ms. Sig-Od&#39;s loved ones, friends and Seneca classmates and professors. Counselling and support services are available to the Seneca community.&#34;A GoFundMe page, started by Pastor Marvin Dolores, is raising funds for the funeral and to send the victims&#39; bodies back to the Philippines.&#34;They do not have relatives here in Ontario to arrange their funeral, so as their pastor, I decided to ask for your help to raise funds,&#34; Dolores wrote on the page.Meanwhile, Mendoza says femicide is preventable and there are often signs and red flags. But in many cases, people may not know how to help.She suggests seeking out expert help to support a friend or family member in trouble.In Toronto, crisis support can be accessed by calling the Assaulted Women&#39;s Helpline at 1-877-945-4478.2 dead, 1 in custody after reported stabbing in vehicle in Toronto following &#39;obvious struggle&#39;CBC&#39;s Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Arnold was charged for a fatal shooting in Calgary earlier this month. He has a long list of prior offences, including a murder charge in 2020. (Edmonton Police Service)Two weeks before he allegedly shot and killed a Calgary woman as she sat in the front seat of her car with her husband, a Sherwood Park man is accused of committing nine offences, including assault with a weapon, pointing a firearm and possession of a prohibited firearm, court documents reveal.On Aug. 18, Nakita Baron, 31, was fatally shot in her Bentley in the southwest Calgary community of Evergreen. Her husband, Talal Fouani, 46, was also shot but survived and remains in hospital. CBC News has learned that Fouani was out on bail awaiting trial on organized crime charges.On Friday, Calgary police laid charges of first-degree murder and attempted murder against Michael Tyrel Arnold, 34, who was arrested by Edmonton police for the Evergreen shooting. In 2020, Arnold was charged with second-degree murder stemming from a 2019 homicide of a 45-year-old man in Edmonton. That charge was stayed after a preliminary hearing in November 2020, but it is not known why.In early August police laid the assault and firearms charges but could not locate Arnold. Warrants were issued for his arrest, according to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service.Arnold remained at large until he was arrested on Aug. 25 on the first-degree murder charge.The accused killer&#39;s past convictions tell the story of a drug trafficker with a history of breaching court conditions who was also subject to a lifetime firearms ban.In 2018, a 2½-year sentence was imposed after Arnold was convicted of trafficking. In 2014, Arnold was handed a four-year sentence for drug trafficking and evading police.Arnold remains in custody and will be back in court in September. In a statement to CBC News, Fouani&#39;s family said they are grateful for police efforts in investigating the shooting that killed Baron and sent her husband to hospital in life-threatening condition.&#34;This has taken an immense toll on our family. The passing of Ms. Baron is a tragedy. We lost an important member of our family and we are heartbroken,&#34; the statement said. CorrectionsAn earlier version of this story stated that Michael Arnold was arrested and granted bail two weeks before he was charged with murder. In fact, after he was charged with weapons and assault offences, police could not locate Arnold and warrants were issued for his arrest.

(Mike Symington/CBC)Fifteen people and a Calgary business have been charged following a cross-border, $55-million drug bust.It&#39;s believed they were moving cocaine and methamphetamine produced by Mexican cartels to Alberta, says a police organization dedicated to serious and organized crime. Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams (ALERT) said Wednesday the investigation started in 2020 and involved Calgary police, U.S. Homeland Security and officers in Niagara, Ont., Saskatchewan and Osoyoos, B.C.Fifteen people now face more than 80 charges. Meth and cocaine believed to be on the way to Alberta was seized in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, ALERT said. Lead investigator Sgt. Tara McNeil said the drugs seized were destined for the &#34;streets of Calgary&#34; and across the province. Among those charged is Calgarian Talal Fouani, 46, said McNeil. In August, Fouani and his wife were shot in his Bentley outside their southwest Calgary home. Fouani survived, but his wife, Nakita Baron, 31, died of her injuries.Talal Fouani, left, was on bail for organized crime and money laundering charges when he was shot while sitting in his parked Bentley outside his southwest Calgary home. Fouani&#39;s wife, Nakita Baron, 31, was killed. (Instagram/Nakita Baron)CBC News learned that Fouani was out on bail awaiting trial on organized crime charges. Now Fouani faces charges related to laundering proceeds of crime, participation in a criminal organization and possession of property obtained by crime, ALERT says.  Fourteen other people, including Belal Fouani, and a company called Fouani Equity Funds Ltd., have been charged with offences ranging from participation in a criminal organization, importation of a controlled substance, laundering proceeds of crime and drug trafficking.But McNeil says ALERT alleges that a man named Ricco King, 50, is believed to be the top figure in the crime organization. King faces charges of trafficking, laundering the proceeds of crime and participation in a criminal organization. ALERT said these vehicles were seized in connection with Project Cobra.  (ALERT)McNeil said two multimillion-dollar mansions — in Halifax and Niagara-on-the-Lake — belonging to King have been placed under criminal restraint. McNeil said all of the accused were charged in Calgary, and their court cases will be tried in the city. McNeil said they believe the drugs originated in Mexico, and the &#34;criminal organization&#34; had established links with cartels in that country. However, she said the organization didn&#39;t have a name and wasn&#39;t defined by age or race.&#34;It was a group of people that were working together for the benefit of the group and to make as much money as possible and import as many drugs as they possibly could,&#34; she said. ALERT dubbed the investigation &#34;Project Cobra.&#34;In a media release, ALERT said meth and cocaine bound for Alberta has been seized in Wyoming, Los Angeles, Lake Koocanusa, B.C., and North Battleford, Sask. Drugs were also seized in Calgary. &#34;The numbers are staggering … $55 million in drugs intercepted, nearly one metric tonne of methamphetamine that was destined for Alberta communities,&#34; said Supt. Marc Cochlin, ALERT chief executive officer. &#34;The amount of harm that mountain of methamphetamine brings to our communities is very disturbing.&#34; ALERT says 928 kilograms of methamphetamine and six kilograms of cocaine were intercepted, and about $7 million worth of property has been seized or placed under criminal restraint.A $3.5-million home in Niagara-on-the-Lake, two Lamborghinis, a Porsche and classic cars are among the possessions under criminal restraint. These are all the profits of a organized crime, said Cochlin. Nineteen firearms were also seized, which included handguns, rifles, submachine guns and suppressors.Three people face more than five charges in connection with Project Cobra:William Whiteford, 39, from Leduc County, charged with 20 offences.Elias Ade, 38, from Calgary, charged with 12 offences.Jarett Mackenzie, 32, from Calgary, charged with 6 offences.Cochlin said he believes this is likely the biggest drug bust in Alberta&#39;s history. ABOUT THE AUTHORJade MarkusDigital journalistJade Markus is a digital journalist at CBC Calgary.
