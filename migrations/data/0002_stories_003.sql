“There has been cannibalism. Cannibalism is the great fear.” —Man, “The Road” (2009)
In A Nutshell
On December 20, 1879, the citizens of Alberta, Canada, witnessed their first official hanging. The man dangling at the end of the rope was a Cree Native American by the name of Swift Runner. What was his crime? Well, Swift Runner cannibalized his entire family. But he laid the blame on an evil spirit called a wendigo.
The Whole Bushel
If you know anything about Native American mythology, then you’ve probably heard of the wendigo. An evil spirit with too-tight skin and terrifying antlers, the wendigo enjoyed dining on human flesh. Of course, this sinister creature is just a myth, but if you traveled back to 19th-century Canada, you’d probably find a lot of people who’d disagree with that statement.
To many of the Algonquin tribe, the wendigo was very real—and also had a bad habit of possessing unsuspecting people and turning them into cannibals. Unfortunately, during the 1800s, several Algonquin natives actually did feast on their fellow humans, a result of a mental disorder modern-day psychologists call wendigo psychosis. And perhaps the most infamous “victim” of this horrifying condition was a Cree by the name of Swift Runner.
Born in Alberta as Ka-Ki-Si-Kutchin, Swift Runner was a popular man in the Cree community and the father of six children. At over 180 centimeters (6′) tall, he was a giant of a man, and made his living as a trapper and a guide for the North West Mounted Police.
But over time, Swift Runner developed a taste for whiskey (possibly because he’d lost his ability to hunt and take care of his family) and fell into the throes of alcoholism. Making things worse, Swift Runner was an angry drunk, and his drinking habits got him into trouble. First, he was fired by the police force, and then he was kicked out of his tribe thanks to his violent tendencies.
Then in the winter of 1878, Swift Runner took his family—his wife, six children, his mother-in-law, and brother—out into the forest. Several months later as spring rolled around, Swift Runner staggered out of the woods and into a nearby Catholic mission. When the priests asked what was wrong, Swift Runner said his entire family was dead.
During the winter, he hadn’t been able to find any food. Slowly but surely, all his relatives had starved to death.
The priests were somewhat suspicious, however. Swift Runner looked pretty healthy. Why hadn’t he succumbed to starvation? Plus, they knew quite a few other Cree who’d had a pretty successful winter, hunting-wise. The priests were also disturbed by Swift Runner’s constant nightmares. The man would wake up in the night screaming at the top of his lungs. The last straw was when Swift Runner tried to lead a group of children out into the woods.
Article Continued Below
Convinced he’d killed his family, the priests went to the authorities. The police put Swift Runner under arrest and ordered the big man to lead them to his winter campsite. Now, sources disagree on what exactly happened next. Some say Swift Runner immediately took them to the spot. Others say he intentionally tried to mislead them, only cooperating after he was made drunk. Either way, when the group eventually stumbled upon the campsite, they found a truly horrifying scene.
There were bones everywhere, some broken in half and hollowed out. That could only mean one thing. Someone had snapped them open and sucked out the marrow. Their suspicions were confirmed when they found a pot full of human fat.
That’s when Swift Runner pulled the wendigo defense. According to Swift Runner, he’d been possessed by an evil spirit. That’s when he’d murdered and eaten his entire family. But as you might expect, that didn’t really fly with authorities. When Swift Runner went to trial in 1879, the jury didn’t buy his supernatural tale, and after 20 minutes of deliberation, they sentenced the Cree to death.
Swift Runner was eventually executed on December 20, 1879. In fact, he was the first man legally hanged in Alberta, Canada. Before his death, the big man converted to Catholicism, and moments before the trap door dropped, he gave a speech admitting his guilt.
Quite a few people came to watch Swift Runner meet his maker, including one spectator, who claimed it was the 29th hanging he’d witnessed, was thoroughly impressed with the show. As this execution connoisseur later put it, “It was the prettiest hanging I’ve ever seen.”

City &amp; Politics, History		The Altona school shooting of 1902
Jim Chliboyko / Friday, March 15th 2013
It’s an undeveloped and puzzling line, a very brief Wikipedia entry, regarding something referred to as the “Altona school shooting” back in 1902. What happened in Altona–though, ultimately not as destructive as more recent acts of violence in Colorado and Connecticut schools–is a reminder that there’s been more than one such similar incident in Manitoba (the other being at the killing of a student at Sturgeon Creek Secondary in 1978).
What happened in Altona, happened on Oct. 9, 1902; it would eventually claim two lives while wounding five. The headline in the Manitoba Free Press on Friday, October 10th, read, in all-caps: Shot Seven and Five May Die. The Winnipeg Daily Tribune, meanwhile, proclaimed one was dead and three fatally wounded by the “death-dealing demon” or “human fiend.” Those three eventually recovered.
“A tragedy startling in its suddenness and diabolical in its intent, has created intense excitement in this village and placed on record a crime which has been unequalled in the history of western Canada,” read the Free Press.
The shooter was a man named Henry Toews (he is sometimes given the middle initial I or J). And he was actually the teacher at the Mennonite school in Old Altona where the shooting took place. He was in his thirties, originally from Russia, and was close to both his octogenarian mother and his brother (his father had died in Russia). The notes on him are contradictory; that he was both loved and hated, that he was a very good teacher, though unreliable, and that he had recently disappeared for a number of months for no evident reason. Toews had also been recently been given some notes on how to be a better teacher, said the Tribune, something that evidently “rankled” him.
One witness was quoted by the Tribune as saying, “I always heard that he was quite a good teacher, but was considered sullen and irritable out of school.”
The two newspapers have differing accounts of what happened that day in Altona. There seems to have been some sort of meeting in the home of one of the school trustees during the school day, regarding Toews’ behaviour towards the children. Toews was living in a room or house connected to the school; neither the Kehler or Rempel families were willing to board him because of his demeanour, which created such hard feelings that he took it out on their daughters, who happened to be his students. In the days after the shooting, the Free Press sent a correspondent to the town, and Peter Kehler told the reporter that they had caught Toews attempting to seal a door with a hammer and nails. Speculation was that he was about to seal himself in the building in case he was dismissed. The three trustees then decided to confront Toews with his behaviour, with Toews asking to take the conversation to the nearby house, so the children didn’t have to witness a confrontation.
Here, again, the accounts differ. The three men had questions for him, which he refused to answer. Toews either retrieved a gun, or had it ready. Soon into the interview’s start, Toews started the shooting, either shooting all three inside (the Tribune has Toews and Kehler fighting over the gun) or shooting one, then pursuing the other men outside. Both papers agreed that John Hiebert was hit first, followed by Abraham Rempel and then Peter Kehler, in the hand.
“Crazed by the sight of his victims, Toews’ passion got beyond all control,” reads the Free Press’ account. “He rushed out of the home and across to the school-room among the children.”
Cruelly, Toews then re-entered the school, and singled out Rempel’s daughter and Peter Kehler’s two daughters, after telling the other children to get back to their studies. He shot the three students point blank. Somehow he only winged the Rempel girl, but more seriously wounded the two Kehler girls. Anna Kehler eventually did die of her wounds, having been shot three times. The rest of the children ran out into the street in a panic.
Toews then exited the building, started walking away from the scene down the railroad tracks towards New Altona, to go after a fourth trustee, as the Free Press surmised, or perhaps to catch a train. But, in a poignant prairie detail, Toews had a threshing team, drawn by the sound of the gunfire, pursuing him, armed with sticks. Another newspaper account said that he dared one of the people present to engage him. Somewhere along the tracks, he shot himself. However, he had aimed too low, and it failed to immediately kill him.
”When Toews fell, the villagers forgot their desire for vengeance and carried him to Dr. Meek’s office, where he was placed under arrest,” reads the Tribune account.
In the days afterwards, more details became clear. Toews had been planning this for some time, it seems.
“In going through the effects of the murderer, a letter was found, which he had just written to a Winnipeg sporting house, asking them to send him a repeating rifle and another revolver,” claimed the Free Press.
Then there were more contradictions.
“It is granted that he is a first-class teacher and that the school in old Altona has shown splendid results under his care,” reads one statement. Yet, in an adjacent article, in the same newspaper: “It seems strange that they would place children under the charge of such a man. Besides being of a tacturn (sic) disposition, it is generally admitted that he was of a weak mind.”
For such a strange (at the time) outburst of violence in such a protected area, for such an incident to occur in a Mennonite community (interestingly referred to as a ‘reserve’ a number of times in the papers), there was little other coverage, other than the immediate facts of the case. There was a half-week or week of follow-up stories. The “unequalled” shooting happened on a Thursday, and after the following Tuesday, the Tribune had no more coverage. Maybe Altona was too far away, maybe the fact that the community was a Mennonite community was enough to set it apart. Unless there was some sort of notification that Toews was in court in the following months, there was no other real follow-up to the shooting, not, at least, that fall. There were also no pictures of anyone–not the victims, not the shooter, not the scene– ever, in the papers of the capital.
And the story didn’t seem to have much in the way of legs with the Free Press, either. Towards the end of that first week the bigger news of the day was getting the larger and more urgent (all-caps) headlines, specifically the news regarding a coal miners’ strike in Pennsylvania.
(The Tribune ran a strange albeit interesting account of Toews’ arrival in Winnipeg on October 10th, lying on a stretcher in a train car with his head encased in bloody bandages, and having to be cajoled by one lawman to get on his feet and disembark on his own power, that his wound wasn’t that bad.)
As the months went on, Toews remained in Winnipeg General, growing a beard and being alert enough to accept guests, like his brother and his mother. He was also told, at one point, that the community forgave him for what he did. According to the Free Press, his brother informed him of the death of Anna Kehler. “The brother also brought a kindly message from the Hiebert, Rempel and Kehler families in which it was stated that they had no hard feelings for the evil he had wrought. At this, the man who had shot down six people in cold blood is said to have broken down completely. He professed the deepest regret concerning the tragedy, and said his memory of that awful day was only returning.”
But he was not a popular patient amongst the nurses, and they were glad when he was transferred to another holding facility. In the roundabout language of the day, it’s difficult to tell if he was merely a nasty person or mentally ill. “The nurses will not regret his departure as he is said to have been more expressive than refined in the use of his language,” read the Free Press.
It’s also informative, to see the 1902 print media in action, keeping in mind that newspapers were the only game in town, really. Many names were spelled wrong at least once. People were proclaimed to be mortally wounded, only to recover. Contradictions, as mentioned, were not in shortage. But the attention span was short; aside from that first week, there were no six-month or one-year anniversary pieces, not at least in the Free Press. Nor were there any calls for new laws, greater protection or movement on any bigger issues, like, say, psychological testing of teachers.
Also, the language around what we would now call “the accused” was different, too. Toews was the guilty party, the newspapers knew that immediately. There was an inquest of sorts held almost immediately–within a day, seemingly, of the crime–and witnesses, mostly classmates of the three wounded girls, presented accounts of what happened, in German. In the accounts of the day, there was never use of the words “alleged” nor “suspect.”
Toews ultimately didn’t live to witness his own judgment. Of course, it’s difficult to say how Toews would have been found in a court of law. But, at this point in Manitoba history, they were still executing people.
Whatever Toews’ mental condition, he seemed to otherwise shrink away. He had moments of “brightness” but the medical officials were always doubtful about his recovery with the “gaping wound below his temple” and the bullet that was still lodged in his head. That wound eventually did claim him in January of 1903. It was only then that the newspapers ran articles about the shooting again. It turns out the second victim of Toews’ shooting was Toews himself. His family claimed the body.

Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 108, known as the Sault-au-Cochon Tragedy, was a Douglas DC-3 operated by Canadian Pacific Air Lines (registry CF-CUA S/N: 4518) that was blown up by a dynamite time bomb on 9 September 1949. The plane was flying from Montreal to Baie-Comeau, Quebec, with a stopover at Quebec City, when it was destroyed. All 19 passengers and 4 crew members were killed in the explosion and crash.
Investigators discovered that three people, Joseph-Albert Guay (22 September 1917 – 12 January 1951), Généreux Ruest (1898 – 25 July 1952), and Marguerite Pitre (5 September 1908 – 9 January 1953), had conspired to destroy the plane to obtain life insurance money. Guay himself had wanted to kill his wife, who was a passenger, so he could marry his mistress. All three of them were tried for murder and executed.
Background[edit]
Joseph-Albert Guay was born the youngest of five children on 22 September 1917 in Charny, Quebec. His father was killed in a railroad accident when he was aged 5 and the family moved to a suburb of Quebec City.[1]
During World War II, Guay obtained a draft deferment. In August 1941, he married Rita Morel and moved to Quebec City, where he worked at the Arsenal and sold jewelry and watches on the side. During this time, Guay met a watchmaker named Généreux Ruest, becoming close friends with Ruest and his sister, Marguerite Pitre. Towards the end of the war, Guay started selling jewelry fulltime, offering engagement rings, crucifixes, and watches. He also picked up damaged watches and took them to Ruest, who had his own workshop, to be repaired. Ruest and his wife moved to Sept-Îles, where the couple had a daughter in 1945.[1]
Pitre was born in Saint-Octave-de-Métis, Quebec. She ran a boarding house at Saint-Roch, and was known by her neighbours and later the press as &#34;Madame le Corbeau&#34; (&#34;Madame Raven&#34;) because she always wore black.[2] or La femme Pitre in Quebec.[3]
Motive[edit]
In the summer of 1947, Guay met and started an affair with 17-year-old waitress Marie-Ange Robitaille (she told Guay she was 19). Robitaille knew Guay was married and had a child, but Guay introduced himself to her parents as a young single man under the alias of &#34;Roger Angers&#34;. In about a year, Guay was calling Robitaille, whom he was now regularly meeting, on the phone two or three times a week.[1]
In November 1948, Guay&#39;s wife learned about the affair and told Robitaille&#39;s parents, who then kicked their daughter out of their house. Robitaille contacted Guay, who then called Pitre. Guay and Pitre were close friends, with Pitre saying she was like a mother to the younger man. Pitre owned a boarding house near where Guay and Robitaille met, and had helped arrange some of their meetings. Guay asked Pitre if she could take in Robitaille, to which she agreed. Pitre herself moved a week later, while Guay paid for Robitaille&#39;s rent.[1]
Robitaille&#39;s parents quickly changed their minds about kicking their daughter out. However, it was difficult to communicate with her. Afraid of her parents causing trouble if they found out where she was, Robitaille pretended that she was living in Montreal. In early 1949, however, she decided she wanted to return home and leave Guay. Robitaille borrowed $50 from the owner of the restaurant where she worked and bought a railroad ticket to Montreal. However, Guay followed her to the train and told her that if she didn&#39;t come back, he&#39;d made a scene. Robitaille went back with Guay to the apartment. Guay then warned Robitaille against escaping by burning her gloves and going to bed wearing her coat. The next morning, he cashed in her unused train ticket.[1]
In April 1949, Guay offered a family friend, 21-year-old Lucien Carreau, $500 to kill his wife. His plan was for Carreau to kill Rita with poisoned wine. Carreau called Guay crazy and refused. In June 1949, Guay&#39;s wife became fed up with her husband, took their daughter, and moved in with her mother. Robitaille finally left Guay, returned to her parents, and got a different job at a closer restaurant.[1]
As Robitaille was walking to work one day in June, Guay confronted her, pulled out a gun, and threatened that if she didn&#39;t return to him, he&#39;d shoot himself, and maybe her as well. Robitaille refused. Guay persisted, but fled after a policeman heard them arguing and approached the two. The officer escorted Robitaille to her workplace and waited to see if Guay would return. When he did, Guay was arrested and charged with attempted assault with a deadly weapon. Guay called Pitre, who got him a lawyer. The lawyer managed to get Guay&#39;s charge reduced to illegally carrying a firearm. Guay was fined $25 and set free the following morning.[1]
Two days later, Guay called Robitaille and said they had to meet. She reluctantly agreed. Guay told her his wife was going to have her arrested for damaging his reputation. Guay said Robitaille needed to immediately flee to Montreal and hide there until the threat went away. Robitaille fled to Montreal with Guay. There, he bought her some new clothes, and apparently paid so much attention to her that she agreed to fly with him to Sept-Îles. However, the two were fighting once more within a week.[1]
At the end of July, Robitaille left Guay once more. Guay gave her a note as she left. &#34;I love you terribly,&#34; it read. &#34;We&#39;ll be together again very soon.&#34; The end of the note instructed Robitaille to destroy it afterwards, but she did not. At this point, Guay became serious about trying to kill his wife. He believed the only way he could be with Robitaille would be to marry her. Given the era and circumstances, a divorce was difficult to obtain. Since Guay&#39;s unfaithfulness was well-known, he would be the first suspect if his wife was killed. Guay recruited Ruest and Pitre, both of whom were suffering financial troubles, for his plot. Guay offered Ruest money and a discount on a ring that he wanted to buy for a woman. As for Pitre, she owed Guay $600, a debt he offered to cancel in exchange for her assistance.[1]
Pitre went to a hardware store and found it was impossible to buy dynamite in Canada without signing for it, so she gave a false name. She told the clerk that she was buying on behalf of a woman who wanted to destroy some tree stumps. She bought 20 half-pound sticks of dynamite, 15 detonating caps, and a 30-foot length of fuse. She wrapped the dynamite in a package, which she gave to Guay. Guay took the package to Ruest and, late that night, started on a holiday with his wife. Rita thought the vacation was supposed to be a reconciliation, and Guay acted very kind to her.[1]
Guay and Ruest decided to rig a time bomb. As they were planning, Pitre proposed an alternative plan. They could enlist the help of her neighbor, a taxi driver who she was on good terms with. Pitre said the driver could take Guay&#39;s wife for a ride with the bomb in the trunk. At a certain point, he would pretend that something had gone wrong with the engine, and he and Guay would get out and look for help, leaving Rita by herself. After a few minutes, the bomb would explode. Guay and Ruest encouraged Pitre to follow through on her plan. They listened from hiding as she talked to the taxi driver. However, the man said he wasn&#39;t willing to destroy his cab.[1]
Guay decided to blow up an airplane while his wife was on board. To convince his wife to board the plane, he gave her two suitcases of jewelry which he had in storage since early August. She agreed. Guay contracted a $10,000 insurance policy on his wife on the day of the flight.[1]
Flight 108[edit]
Flight 108 was a Douglas DC-3 operated by Canadian Pacific Air Lines flying from Montreal to Baie-Comeau with a stopover at Quebec City.
Guay calculated that the explosion would send the plane into the Saint Lawrence River which would have made any forensic investigation very difficult with the technology of the time. A five-minute takeoff delay caused the plane to crash instead at Cap Tourmente, near Sault-au-Cochon in the Charlevoix region of Quebec, killing all 23 persons on board – four crew members and 19 passengers including four children. The bombing was the first attack against civil aviation in North America and received wide news coverage locally and abroad. All but three of the victims were Canadians. The three exceptions were the president, president-designate, and vice-president of the Kennecott Copper Corporation.[1][4]
Arrests, trials, and executions[edit]
Since the plane had crashed onto land instead of into water, the police had more access to evidence. They soon realized that the explosion was not an accident. One officer told a reporter about the case, who wrote, without mentioning names, that the police were searching for a woman who delivered an unusual package to the airport.[1]
The story appeared on September 15, but Guay did not see it until four days later. He then went to Pitre and said they were in serious trouble. However, he proposed a solution. Guay said Pitre should kill herself and leave a note admitting sole responsibility for the explosion. Pitre refused. Instead, she called her doctor and complained about abdominal problems. After being taken to the hospital, she took enough sleeping pills to make her drowsy. On September 23, Pitre returned home and was questioned by the police. She confessed to taking a package to the airport on September  as a favor for Guay. Pitre concealed her own complicity, claiming Guay had told her that the package contained a statue.[1][5][6]
Albert Guay was arrested two weeks after the crash and tried in February 1950. While awaiting trial, an informant reported that he said Ruest had made the mechanism of the bomb. The police went to Ruest, who admitted this, but said he thought the bomb was going to be used to blast tree stumps.[1]
Guay showed a lack of interest in his trial and did not testify in his own defense. His only display of emotion throughout the entire trial happened when Robitaille took the stand and said she didn&#39;t love him anymore. Guay was found guilty of murder on 14 March 1950. The judge, Albert Sévigny, cried as he presented a photo of Rita&#39;s body. Upon being convicted, Guay was sentenced to death by hanging. Before passing sentence, Sévigny declared to Guay, &#34;Your crime is infamous. It has no name.&#34;[7][8][9]
Guay did not file an appeal, &#34;for reasons known only to myself,&#34; he said. The prosecutor said that if Guay could not live with Robitaille, he did not want to live at all. Guay was executed on 12 January 1951, at the age of 33. His last words were &#34;Au moins, je meurs célèbre&#34; (At least I die famous).[1]
Before he was executed, however, Guay did send an extremely detailed 40-page confession directly to the Premier of Quebec, Maurice Duplessis.[10][11] As a result, Ruest was arrested for murder on 6 June 1950, and tried in November of that year. The jury had the option of convicting him of manslaughter, but chose to convict him of murder. Marguerite Pitre was arrested on 14 June 1950, and tried separately, beginning 6 March 1951. Both were sentenced to death by hanging.[12]
Ruest was hanged on 25 July 1952. Suffering from osseous tuberculosis, he had to be transported to the gallows in a wheelchair.[13] Pitre was hanged on 9 January 1953,[14] the thirteenth and last woman to be hanged in Canada. All three executions took place at Bordeaux Prison in Montreal.[1]
Aftermath[edit]
Six years later on 1 November 1955, a copycat airplane bombing was apparently inspired by the Guay affair, the same way Guay himself had been apparently inspired by the Philippines woman who blew up an airplane bomb to kill her husband.[15][16] The bombing of United Airlines Flight 629 by Jack Gilbert Graham killed all 44 people aboard, including his mother. Graham&#39;s motive was his mother&#39;s mistreatment of him as a small child, and featured similarities to the earlier bombings including placing a dynamite time-bomb in the target&#39;s suitcase and, just like Guay, Graham had purchased life insurance on his victim shortly before the flight.
In popular culture[edit]
The incident, subsequent trials and execution of Guay and his accomplices was notorious in Quebec and was inspiration for the fictional The Crime of Ovide Plouffe (Le Crime d&#39;Ovide Plouffe, a 1982 novel by Roger Lemelin and 1984 film of the same name by Denys Arcand).[17] In 1949, Lemelin had been a friend and neighbour of Guay, as well as being the Quebec correspondent for Time magazine. The novel Cape Torment by Richard Donovan is based on the case.[15]
