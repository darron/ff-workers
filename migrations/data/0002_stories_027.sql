CAMPBELLTON, N.B. --
A New Brunswick review board has declined to give new privileges to the man found not criminally responsible in the 2018 killings of four people in Fredericton.
Matthew Raymond is being held at the Restigouche Hospital Centre in Campbellton, N.B.
In December Justice Larry Landry of the Court of Queen&#39;s Bench deemed Raymond &#34;high risk&#34; and ordered that he be detained in a high-security hospital.
Raymond shot and killed Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright, as well as Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello on Aug. 10, 2018.
During the nine-week first-degree murder trial, the defence argued Raymond had a mental illness and believed he was defending himself from demons.
The review board had to conduct an initial review of Raymond&#39;s treatment within 90 days of the court decision.
Participants, including Raymond, his mother Shirley Raymond and members of the medical team at the hospital, were linked via a video conference Wednesday.
Psychiatrist Dr. Ralph Holly presented a report, prepared March 1, that said Raymond is following his treatment plan but is still a threat to society.
Holly said Raymond is able to walk around the unit where he is being held, but he asked the board to allow extra privileges, including escorted trips outside the hospital.
In his order in December, Justice Landry said Raymond must remain within the Restigouche hospital and only be allowed outside if &#34;a structured plan has been prepared to address any risk related to the accused&#39;s absence.&#34;
The board ruled Wednesday that a structured plan had not been prepared, and as a result the extra privileges were denied.
The board agreed to allow Raymond&#39;s mother to visit her son at the hospital now that the province is back into the yellow level of the province&#39;s COVID-19 recovery plan.
Raymond was given a chance to speak and said he&#39;s &#34;very sorry&#34; for what happened.
&#34;I&#39;m sad for the deceased, and I&#39;m sad for the families, and I think about them all the time. I call them precious people,&#34; he said.
Board officials said eight victim impact statements had been submitted to the board, but none was read aloud at the hearing.
The review board is to meet annually to review Raymond&#39;s status.
Crown prosecutor Claude Hache sought to have that period extended to three years, but the board said the psychiatrist&#39;s report indicated a potential for improvement in Raymond&#39;s condition, so the next hearing will be a year from now.
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Mar. 10, 2021.

Matthew Vincent Raymond and the 2018 Fredericton Shooting That Left Four Dead
Published August 8, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime, Guns
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.

On August 10, 2018, ten children lost a parent when one colossally stupid 48-year-old man chose to take out his rage against the world on four innocent people.
Murdered that terrible day were:
Fredericton Police Force Constable Sara Mae Helen Burns, mother of three
Fredericton Police Force Constable Lawrence Robert Costello, father of four
Donnie Robichaud, father of three, and
Bobbie Lee Wright, Robichaud’s girlfriend
Their accused murderer, Matthew Vincent Raymond, was eventually disarmed by other members of the Fredericton Police Force, but not soon enough to save the lives of these four victims.
What We Know
Matthew Vincent Raymond positioned himself at the third-floor window of an apartment building in Fredericton, New Brunswick, at 7am, a loaded rifle in hand, and began shooting.
Matthew Raymond faces four counts of first-degree murder and will likely stand trial in September 2020.
What We Don’t Know
What nobody knows is why.
Why did Matthew Raymond shoot and kill Donnie Robichaud and Robichaud’s new girlfriend, Bobbie Lee Wright, as they packed up their car for a weekend getaway?
Why did Matthew Raymond shoot and kill the first two responding police officers, Fredericton Police Force Constables Sara Burns and Lawrence Costello?
Did his “ignorant and uninformed” hatred of Syrian refugees have anything to do with it? If so, why murder people with no connection to Syrian refugees?
Unfit To Stand Trial
On October 4, 2019, a jury ruled Matthew Raymond was unfit to stand trial. This means he could not, at that time, understand the charges against him or properly instruct a lawyer.
This is not the same as not criminally responsible, which deals with the killer’s mental state at the time of the murders, and defence counsel readily admits his client, Matthew Raymond, is the killer.
“Mr. Raymond was the shooter, said Nathan Gorham. “We all know that. The issue is what was his mental disorder and what impact did that mental disorder have.”
As a result of the jury’s determination, Matthew Raymond was sent to Restigouche Hospital Centre, a psychiatric facility, to undergo a 60-day evaluation which includes anti-psychotic medication to deal with his “current condition” – a condition which was not identified to the public.
“We think it [the jury’s verdict Raymond is not fit to stand trial] was a very fair decision, and we’re pleased to see that one of the important safeguards in our system worked properly,” Gorham said.
“The fitness provisions allow the parties to raise the issue of fitness when there is reasonable grounds concerning whether the person by reason of a mental disorder is unable to participate in their defence, either by understanding the nature of the proceedings or by instructing their counsel. It ensures we only have to do trials once and avoids mistrials or appeals by ensuring that the trial is fair the first go-around,” he concluded.
He will stand trial for first-degree murder once he is deemed mentally fit to do so.
Gorham said his client “has been anxious for the last 10 months that we have the trial as quickly as possible. We are thankful that we are on the home stretch here and hopefully will be getting to trial soon.”
Matthew Vincent Raymond is currently on anti-psychotic medication, against his will, and is doing well, according to Dr. Ralph Holly.
Murder Trial Scheduled Despite COVID-19 Delays
On September 28, 2020, Matthew Vincent Raymond will stand trial on four counts of first-degree murder, said Justice Fred Ferguson of the New Brunswick Court of Queen’s Bench.
Before that trial can take place, however, there will be a second “fitness” trial scheduled for August 17, 2020, at which a second jury will decide if the killer is now fit to face the charges against him.

A domestic terrorist vehicle-ramming attack occurred on April 23, 2018, when a rented van was driven along Yonge Street through the North York City Centre business district in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The driver, 25-year-old Alek Minassian, targeted pedestrians, killing 11[n 1] and injuring 15, some critically.[5] The incident is the deadliest vehicle-ramming attack in Canadian history.[6][7][8][9][10]
The attack started at the intersection of Yonge Street and Finch Avenue and proceeded south along the sidewalks of Yonge Street to near Sheppard Avenue. Nine of the eleven deceased victims were women.[11][12] Minassian was taken into custody just south of the crime scene, after leaving the van and reportedly attempting to commit suicide by cop. The arrest was made at 1:32 p.m. EDT, seven minutes after the first 9-1-1 call reporting the incident was made.[13]
The attack is characterized as misogynist terrorism because it was motivated by revenge for perceived sexual and social rejection by women. At the time of his arrest, Minassian described himself as an incel to the police and in prior social media postings, and described the attack as the continuation of an &#34;incel rebellion&#34;, started by the late Elliot Rodger.[14] Minassian pleaded not criminally responsible to the 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder in November 2020, but was found guilty on all counts in March 2021.[15] Anne Molloy, the judge of the case, stated in Minassian&#39;s guilty verdict that &#34;working out his exact motivation for this attack is ... close to impossible&#34; but she &#34;was inclined to accept&#34; assessments by multiple expert witnesses that Minassian likely lied to the police and that notoriety was his main motivation, although misogyny or incel ideology may have played a role.[1] On June 13, 2022, Minassian was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 25 years.[16]
Attack[edit]
The first 9-1-1 call reporting pedestrians being hit was received at 1:25 p.m. Eastern Time.[17][18] At Finch Avenue, a white Chevrolet Express van, rented from Ryder, ran a red light, then drove southbound on the west-side sidewalk of Yonge Street, striking multiple pedestrians.[18][19] The van continued along the sidewalk for several more blocks, striking additional pedestrians.[20][21] Security camera video from a local business shows the van reaching Tolman Street, which is one block south of Finch Avenue, at 1:24 p.m. At one point, the van re-entered the roadway due to the narrowness of the sidewalk, but at Park Home Avenue, the van again drove onto the sidewalk, hitting pedestrians in front of Mel Lastman Square, a civic plaza on the west side of Yonge Street, 1.4 kilometres (0.87 mi) south of Finch Avenue (16 blocks).[22]
Paramedics were immediately called to the site, and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre was activated as an emergency centre.[23]
Mel Lastman Square in June 2015
A single police officer in traffic control capacity,[24] Toronto Police Service constable Ken Lam, intercepted the damaged van, which was stopped on the north sidewalk on Poyntz Avenue, just west of Yonge Street and two blocks south of Sheppard Avenue, about 2.3 kilometres (1.4 mi) south of where the attack began. Lam stopped his unmarked cruiser near the van and confronted the suspected driver, later identified as Alek Minassian, standing near the opened driver-side door.[20][25]
During the confrontation, Minassian repeatedly drew his hand from his back pocket and pointed a dark-coloured object toward the officer as if it were a pistol.[25][26][27] Lam ordered Minassian to drop to the ground, while Minassian tried repeatedly to provoke the officer to kill him, demanding he be shot &#34;in the head!&#34; when the officer warned him he may be shot. Lam then went to his cruiser and turned off its siren. As Minassian and Lam advanced towards each other, the officer recognized that the object in Minassian&#39;s hand was not a gun, holstered his pistol, and took out his baton to avoid the use of unnecessary lethal force. Minassian then dropped the object from his hand, lay down on the ground and surrendered to Lam. He was arrested at 1:32 p.m.[28]
Nine people died at the scenes. At 8:15 p.m., the Toronto Police Service announced that a tenth person had died. An eleventh person died on October 28, 2021, after being paralyzed from the neck down and never leaving the hospital.[23][4]

Police identified the suspect as Alek Minassian, who had no prior criminal history.[41][42] His father, Vahe, had moved from Armenia to Canada and worked as a software developer, and his mother, Sona, was from Iran and had a job at IT company Compugen Inc.[43]  Minassian was also an aspiring software and mobile app developer.[44]
According to his LinkedIn profile, he was a student at Seneca College in North York from 2011 to 2018 and lived in Richmond Hill. Minassian had attended Sixteenth Avenue Public School, an elementary school in Richmond Hill, in a special education class.[45][44] His former classmates at Thornlea Secondary School in Thornhill described him as &#34;not overly social&#34; and &#34;harmless&#34;.[28][46] Minassian attended a special needs class for students within the autism spectrum while at Thornlea Secondary School;[47] Minassian&#39;s mother is quoted as saying in a 2009 article that her son has Asperger syndrome.[48]
In late 2017, Minassian enrolled in the Canadian Armed Forces for two months, before requesting voluntary release after 16 days of recruit training.[49] A senior military official said that Minassian &#34;wasn&#39;t adapting to military life, including in matters of dress, deportment and group interactions in a military setting&#34; and &#34;there were no red flags and nothing that would point to anything like this.&#34;[50]
Following the attack, a Facebook post made by Minassian was uncovered in which he identified himself as an incel (&#34;involuntary celibate&#34;).[28][51] The state of involuntary celibacy refers to being unable to find sexual partners[52] and its subculture consists of primarily male online communities.[53][54] The post, dated shortly before the beginning of the attack on April 23, allegedly read:
Private (Recruit) Minassian Infantry 00010, wishing to speak to Sgt 4chan please. C23249161. The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys! All hail the Supreme Gentleman Elliot Rodger![10][55]
&#34;Chad&#34; and &#34;Stacy&#34; are nicknames used on incel-related forums within 4chan and Reddit, to refer to popular, attractive, sexually active men and women, respectively.[56][57] The term &#34;Incel Rebellion&#34; is sometimes used interchangeably with the term &#34;Beta Uprising&#34; or &#34;Beta Male Uprising&#34;, which refers to a violent response to sexlessness.[58] Elliot Rodger was the &#34;incel founding father&#34; who committed the 2014 Isla Vista killings in California, and someone whom Minassian claimed to have had contact with up until the days before the 2014 attacks.[59][60][61] Rodger intended to target attractive women and sexually successful men, which led to him being posthumously idolized by some people on misogynistic online fringe communities, including several incel websites.[62] Facebook, Inc. verified the account as Minassian&#39;s.[28][60] A source in the Department of National Defence told media that C23249161 was Minassian&#39;s military identification number during his army training.[63]
Legal proceedings[edit]
On April 24, 2018, Minassian appeared without a lawyer before the Ontario Court of Justice in a Toronto courthouse, shackled and wearing a white prison jumpsuit. He was charged with 10 counts of first degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder and ordered not to contact any of the alleged attempted murder victims.[41][64] His father, Vahe Minassian, attended the hearing. He told reporters that he had not spoken to his son.[65] Minassian was charged with three additional counts of attempted murder on May 10: a total of 16 counts.[66] He later retained Toronto criminal defence lawyer Boris Bytensky to represent him.[67] His trial was initially scheduled for February 10, 2020,[68] later moved to March 2,[69] and later moved to April 6, but was postponed again because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto to November.[14][70]
The trial began on November 10, 2020 and was conducted over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[71] Minassian, who had already admitted to planning and carrying out the attack, pleaded not criminally responsible to the 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder.[72][73] During testimony on November 12, a psychiatrist retained by Minassian&#39;s defence team stated in a report that Minassian&#39;s &#34;autistic way of thinking was severely distorted in a way similar to psychosis,&#34; despite Minassian not being technically psychotic.[74] Attempts by Minassian and his defence to claim that he was not responsible for his actions due to his autism garnered criticism from autism rights advocates, who expressed concerns that the trial might worsen stigmas towards autistic people.[1] Minassian was also found to be highly intelligent.[75]
In the decision, Ontario Superior Court Justice Anne Molloy believed that Minassian seemed to be motivated by the desire for notoriety, and referred to him as &#34;Mr. Doe&#34; so as to avoid giving him further recognition.[1] She wrote, &#34;It is almost impossible to tell when Mr. Doe is lying and when he is telling the truth. Working out his exact motivation for this attack is likewise close to impossible,&#34; but that &#34;nevertheless, I am inclined to accept the assessment of all of the experts that Mr. Doe did lie to the police about much of the incel motivation he talked about and that the incel movement was not in fact a primary driving force behind the attack.&#34;[1] She also rejected his attempt to use his autism as a defence.[2] On March 3, 2021, Minassian was found guilty on all counts in a verdict that was given by Molloy and streamed live on YouTube.[76] However, sentencing was deferred until 2022 to await the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the appeal of Alexandre Bissonnette on whether prisoners can be made to serve murder sentences consecutively.[77] On June 13, 2022, Minassian was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 25 years.[16] He filed a notice of appeal the following month, arguing among other things that the trial judge &#34;misapprehended&#34; expert evidence and made unreasonable findings.[78]
Aftermath[edit]
The Toronto subway and bus services in the area were immediately closed or rerouted by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC).[25] Parts of Yonge Street were cordoned off until late on April 24, 2018 for the police investigation.[79][21] Civic buildings in the area were closed late April 23 and remained closed throughout April 24. Area businesses were allowed to remain open, but in areas of pedestrian deaths, those fronting on Yonge Street were allowed access from only  the rear entrances.[80] Many businesses in the most affected areas chose to close down for all of April 24, while some opened at different times of the afternoon of April 24. The area was fully open and transit services resumed by April 25.
Security was heightened around a meeting of G7 security ministers being held in Toronto in advance of the 44th G7 summit in La Malbaie, Quebec.[81] The ministers were briefed on the attack shortly after it occurred and the day after the attack, the meeting&#39;s agenda included discussion on &#34;soft targets&#34;, terrorism and social media, and online youth radicalization.[82] The incident was included in the 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada.[83] Faisal Hussain,  perpetrator of the 2018 Toronto shooting had also developed an interest in inceldom prior to his attack but police found no evidence of radicalization.[84]
Sporting events[edit]
Around the Air Canada Centre, roads were closed and blocked off with dump trucks, due to safety concerns for fans gathered at Maple Leaf Square to watch the National Hockey League playoff game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins on the evening of April 23.[85][86] A moment of silence was observed during the game in sympathy for the victims.[87]
Concrete barriers were put up along the edge of the northern sidewalk along Bremner Boulevard in front of the Rogers Centre, due to the same safety concerns prior to the Toronto Blue Jays baseball game against the Boston Red Sox on April 24, 2018.[88] Prior to the game, the Blue Jays honoured a few of the first responders in a ceremony, which included a video memorial for the victims of the attack followed by a moment of silence.[89]
Reactions[edit]

Many domestic leaders expressed their support and condolences in the immediate aftermath of the attack, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,[90] Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer,[90] Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne,[19] and Toronto Mayor John Tory.[91]
Constable Ken Lam was lauded as a hero for his measured use of force to achieve a non-fatal resolution of his confrontation with Minassian, despite Minassian&#39;s seeking suicide by cop.[92] Lam insisted that he was simply performing his duty.[93][94]
Lighting at the CN Tower and the 3D Toronto sign at Nathan Phillips Square were colourless and dimmed for the evening of April 23, 2018. Flags were placed at half-mast at most government locations in Toronto and surrounding municipalities.[95]
An impromptu memorial at Olive Square Park on the east-side of Yonge Street, directly across the street from where the attack began, was started by a local resident at 5:15 p.m. of the same day for people to place flowers and express their grief in writing.[96] The person who started the memorial indicated that all the other public spaces along Yonge Street, including Mel Lastman Square, were cordoned off by police tape so he chose Olive Square which was not cordoned off.[97] Small memorials ranging from a few bunches of flowers to about two dozen bunches of flowers, plus paper messages, photographs and candles in some cases, were established at each location from just south of Finch Avenue to just south of Park Home Avenue where a pedestrian was killed (at the southwest corner of Yonge Street and Park Home Avenue two victims were killed).[98] Next to the fountain at the entry to Mel Lastman Square, where the greatest number of people were struck (at least two killed), another memorial gradually grew to become a hub memorial almost as large as the one at Olive Square.[98]
#TorontoStrong[edit]
Several crowdfunding campaigns were set up to raise money for the expenses of the victims&#39; families.[99][100] To better coordinate crowdfunding, the City of Toronto established the #TorontoStrong Fund to support victims and their families, first responders, and those affected by trauma.[101] The hashtag was reused in memoriam of the victims of a fatal mass shooting that occurred in the Danforth on July 22 of the same year.
Several vigils were held in the following week. A small vigil was held at Lastman Square on the evening of April 24.[102] Another was held by the Toronto Korean Community Association on April 27 at Lastman Square. An official #TorontoStrong Vigil was held by the City of Toronto on April 29, attended by several thousand.[103][102] It began with a march from Yonge Street and Finch Avenue and ended with a gathering at Lastman Square. Speaking at the gathering were community leaders and the event was attended by Prime Minister Trudeau, Governor General Julie Payette, Premier Wynne, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, and Mayor Tory.[104][105]
The two main impromptu memorials at Olive Square Park and Mel Lastman Square were decommissioned on June 3, 2018, and later replaced with a temporary plaque. Mayor John Tory announced plans to erect a permanent memorial for the attack.[106]
On June 13, 2018, the #TorontoStrong&#39;s volunteer steering committee announced the appointment of former Toronto mayor Barbara Hall as fund administrator. She was tasked with distributing the money raised for the victims and survivors.[107]
By December 2018, over CA$4 million from the fund had been distributed to victims and families of both the van attack and the Danforth shooting.[108]

Some information may no longer be current.Open this photo in gallery:Ula Theoret, a former nurse and mother of three grown sons, moved to Burk’s Falls, Ont., in 2014, to look after her aging parents.Fred Lum/The Globe and MailShareBookmarkPlease log in to bookmark this story.Log InCreate Free AccountA triple murder-suicide in rural Ontario is a case study in the ways rape myths and tunnel vision can compromise a police investigation, and should be used to teach police how to handle sexual and domestic violence complaints, a provincial review has found.On Feb. 23, 2018, six months after Ulla Theoret told police that her neighbour, Mark Jones, had sexually assaulted her, Mr. Jones shot and killed her in her Burk’s Falls, Ont., home. He also killed her son Paul, 28, and her mother, Raija Turunen, 88, before turning his gun on himself.Following a Globe and Mail investigation in 2019, which highlighted the warning signs missed by police and others in the tight-knit small town, Ontario’s Domestic Violence Death Review Committee (DVDRC) decided the case warranted a probe, even though it was not a clear-cut instance of domestic violence because Mr. Jones and Ms. Theoret were not officially a couple.The review committee analyzes all cases of intimate-partner homicides in the province and makes recommendations to prevent future deaths. It looks for a list of 41 “indicators” (such as sexual jealousy, prior threats with a weapon, access to firearms, or victim vulnerability) that demonstrate, in hindsight, the potential for lethality. In almost three-quarters of cases the committee reviews, it identifies seven or more risk factors. In this case, there were 13.The committee’s report – which is not public, but was shared with The Globe and Mail by Ms. Theoret’s family – includes recommendations to the Ministry of the Solicitor-General and the Ontario Police College. It calls upon them to review and reframe their policies and training related to intimate-partner and sexual-violence cases, in order to better prepare police to deal with victims who are reluctant to press charges, or whose relationships with their abusers aren’t stereotypically romantic. This tragedy, the report says, should be adopted as a case study by the police college, “to illustrate the complexity of investigating domestic/intimate partner violence, dating violence and sexual assaults as multiple forms of gender-based violence.”Like those made by inquest juries, the committee’s recommendations are non-binding. In an e-mail to The Globe, the Ministry of the Solicitor-General said the police college is constantly updating its course content, and will consider future incorporation of Ms. Theoret’s case. But the ministry said it does not need to implement the committee’s recommendations for updated policies and training, because existing practices are effective at equipping police to deal with domestic and sexual violence.Prabhu Rajan, who is chair of the review committee and chief counsel to the chief coroner, said that while the recommendations are non-binding, “we truly hope that they are persuasive.”He added that he cannot speak for the ministry, or to the intricacies of its policies.“But I guess what I would say is, ‘I hope they’ve thought about it seriously … and if they feel that the policies, as they’re written, adequately deal with the situation, maybe it’s an issue of practice,’” he said. “I hope that anyone involved in this tragic situation [will] reflect and consider what they could have done better.”Ms. Theoret, a former nurse and mother of three grown sons, moved in 2014 to Burk’s Falls, 265 kilometres north of Toronto, to look after her aging parents.Open this photo in gallery:Family photos of the Theoret boys taken at the Burks Falls area home.Fred Lum/The Globe and MailThe DVDRC report notes that Ms. Theoret, who separated from her husband after the move, had an active social life and many friends, but struggled with severe anxiety and depression, for which she was receiving counselling. One of the things troubling her, the report notes, was “unwanted attention from a man (the perpetrator) that her mother wanted her to date.”In the months leading up to her death, Ms. Theoret had become increasingly fearful of Mr. Jones because of his aggressive attempts to court her. And in September, 2017, “after encouragement from several friends and her therapist,” she reported to the Ontario Provincial Police that he had sexually assaulted her. “At that time, she also reported several concerning incidents involving stalking and threatening behavior exhibited by the perpetrator towards her,” the report says.She had confided in friends about her troubling encounters with Mr. Jones, and some had even witnessed his behaviour firsthand. For example, when Ms. Theoret began seeing another man, she would return home from dates to find Mr. Jones waiting for her, the report says. Mr. Jones would also drive by the other man’s house and shout at him, threatening them both.Mr. Jones frequently left unwanted love letters and small gifts in Ms. Theoret’s mailbox. But perhaps most chilling was his use of Ms. Theoret’s own guns as an intimidation tool: “The perpetrator would access the family’s firearms cabinet to examine their firearms, and twice he handled an unloaded firearm, pointed it at [Ms. Theoret] and pulled the trigger,” the report notes.But when Ms. Theoret spoke with police about the sexual assault, the DVDRC report says, she didn’t want to press charges. And she kept the assault a secret from her sons, because she was concerned about what they might say or do.In its recommendations to the Ministry of the Solicitor-General, the DVDRC stresses the need for clear policy and training for police on “managing sexual assault victims who are reluctant to proceed with criminal charges, but may require additional time and counselling to recognize the risks they face from the perpetrator and the potential benefits of engaging in the criminal justice process.”Police policies and training must also reflect a “broad definition” of domestic violence, the report says, including violence that takes place in “dating relationships, online relationships and intimate relationships that may be of brief duration and more one-sided.”As the report notes, police wrote in Ms. Theoret’s file that she “did not resist or say no. She does not want charges at this time.”This summary, the DVDRC says, reflects “an adherence to rape myths” and potential “tunnel vision” by police. If the sexual assault and stalking behaviours Ms. Theoret reported had been considered in the context of intimate-partner violence, the report adds, her case would have been automatically investigated under an Ontario policy that requires police to lay charges in probable domestic violence cases, whether or not a victim agrees.Open this photo in gallery:Ms. Theoret&#39;s wedding day.Fred Lum/The Globe and MailBill Dickson, a spokesperson for the OPP, said in an e-mail Monday that the force “cannot speak for the Ministry of the Solicitor-General or the Ontario Police College,” and declined to comment on the report or the case.“The OPP continually strives for investigative excellence, which includes constant reviewing of policies and procedures surrounding both intimate-partner violence and sexual assault. This includes training all officers, as well as new recruits, on the dynamics of such cases,” Mr. Dickson said.According to the DVDRC report, Ms. Theoret’s last known interaction with Mr. Jones before the day of the murders was in January, 2018 – one month before she was killed.“The perpetrator attended the victim’s home and told her that he knew they belonged together,” the report says. “He was asked to leave and complied.”In the early hours of Feb. 23, 2018, Mr. Jones returned to the family’s rural home and entered through an unlocked door. He shot and killed all three victims with a .40 calibre semi-automatic handgun and a 12-gauge shotgun, the report says. Then he sat in a chair at a kitchen table and shot himself with the handgun. Paul’s girlfriend discovered the four bodies when she arrived at the house that night after work.“Very detailed notes” written by Mr. Jones suggest he had been planning the killings for about three days, the report says. “There was evidence that the perpetrator’s motivation was his anger and jealousy over the victim’s termination of the relationship, rejection of him and new relationship.”Thomas Theoret, one of Ms. Theoret’s surviving sons, said he was pleased with the DVDRC report, and with the possibility that his family’s case would be used to educate police.Had police considered Ms. Theoret and Mr. Jones intimate partners, he said, “then her report to them would have automatically resulted in a domestic-violence case. In that case, action could have been taken on Jones and perhaps it would have helped prevent the havoc he caused.”Mr. Theoret said he believes the report helps to highlight the risks and warning signs that friends, neighbours and family should be aware of.“I can’t help but feel like everyone failed my mom in some way, including myself,” he said.Even the DVDRC itself has been reflecting on its role and ability to make change, Mr. Rajan said.“Do we need to start thinking about how we approach our cases? Maybe we need to demand more in our recommendations,” he said. “I just think we’re at a point now where … things aren’t changing. They aren’t getting any better. So how do we improve things? It’s an ongoing process.”Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.
