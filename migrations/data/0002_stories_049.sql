Toronto’s latest murder victim has been identified as Edwin Farley Alvarado Quintero.
The 49-year-old Woodbridge resident died in hospital after being shot at La Liga Sports Complex, an indoor soccer and basketball facility near Finch Avenue West and Alness Street, just west of Dufferin Street.
Quintero is the city’s 56th homicide victim of the year.
The incident, during which two other men also sustained gunshot wounds, happened on Sunday shortly after 7 p.m. One of the other victims has life-threatening injuries, while the other person’s are serious.
All three men, whom police said are over the age of 20, were taken to local trauma centres.
“We currently have canvassed and spoken to witnesses and we have our forensic identification services on scene and the homicide squad is on their way to take over the investigation,” Duty Insp. Saleem Husain told reporters at the scene Sunday night.
No information is available so far about possible suspects or what may have led to the shooting.
Multiple shell casings were found at the scene, police said. Investigators would not say if the shooting was targeted.
It’s also not clear exactly what was happening inside La Liga when the shooting occurred. According to the complex’s website, the venue hosts indoor soccer games as well as salsa, Zumba, birthday parties, and other activities.
“We all have concern about a shooting, especially in this case where three people have been shot,” Husain said.
“We are doing a full investigation. We&#39;re asking everybody to come forward. We&#39;re working with the community to bring this to a quick resolution.”
The Homicide and Missing Persons Unit is now handling the investigation.
Anyone with further information should contact Toronto police at 416-808-7400, or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-8477 (TIPS) or www.222tips.com.

Two dead in Orleans shooting Wednesday night
Ottawa
Two dead in Orleans shooting Wednesday night
Two Ottawa men were shot and killed in an evening shooting at a plaza in Orléans.
Ottawa police say the shooting in the area of Tompkins Avenue and Tenth Line Road just before 9 p.m. Wednesday was a targeted incident.
&#34;There was just a guy in the middle of the road, so we went to help out,&#34; said Mussa Siddiqui, who owns the African BBQ House in the plaza.
&#34;He was shot; shot three times, bleeding.&#34;
Siddiqui said he saw a second man with gunshot wounds inside a vehicle in the parking lot.
One man was pronounced dead at the scene, while the second man died from his injuries in hospital, police said early Wednesday morning.
A third man was treated for non-life-threatening injuries and was released from hospital overnight.
The victims have been identified as Krishel Kanin Murphy-Nimblett, 28, and Mohamed Omar Mohamed, 23, both of Ottawa.
A man who was at the plaza Wednesday night said several witnesses, including a nurse, rushed to help one of the victims on the ground.
&#34;She told me prior to that he ran over saying, &#39;I got shot, call the ambulance, bring me to the hospital&#39;. He collapsed, she immediately went there and put him into recovery position. I went there and help,&#34; said the man, who asked not to be identified.
&#34;From there we kept trying to keep him conscious, we kept trying to make sure he was OK. We had a nurse that drove by afterwards that helped us too.&#34;
He says the nurse started doing first aid before paramedics arrived.
&#34;After the recovery position, we tried to pull his shirt off to find the gunshot wound. After we found it we removed his shirt completely,&#34; he said. &#34;He was losing consciousness from there, the nurse started doing first aid, he got consciousness back, from there the paramedics got on site and took matters into their hands.&#34;
The witness says Mohamed was an old friend from high school.
&#34;He was a basketball player. I remember I played GCBA with him and his older brother. They were cool people, really nice,&#34; he said. &#34;I remember I was a little overweight back in the day, he was one of them that would stick up for me saying, &#39;Oh no, he&#39;s cool,&#39; shake my hands, keep me around the crowd. He was a really cool guy.
&#34;I&#39;m happy I could&#39;ve been there to help him. I really am.  It&#39;s just a shame I didn&#39;t realize it was him.&#34;
There is no word on any suspects in the case.
Ottawa police Staff Sgt. Jeff Pilon says investigators believe it was a &#34;targeted&#34; shooting.
&#34;We are very mindful today that this is a very tragic incident, that two families have lost loved ones to gunplay in our city and our thoughts are definitely with the families today,&#34; Pilon said Wednesday afternoon.
&#34;There are a lot of investigative steps that need to continue. That will be interviewing anybody that has any type of involvement, seeking out and reviewing any type of surveillance video, there&#39;s a lot of forensic work that needs to be accomplished to help assist with the investigation.&#34;
The evening shooting rattled residents in the east-end neighbourhood.
&#34;This never happens in Orléans; it&#39;s a residential area with families, little kids,&#34; Brigitte Lalonde said. &#34;I&#39;m shocked this happened.&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s crazy. We wouldn&#39;t have expected this to happen in this community,&#34; said Lina Chaar, manager of High Ties. &#34;It&#39;s in Orléans. It&#39;s crazy.&#34;
Anyone with information is asked to contact the Ottawa Police Homicide Unit at 613-236-1222, ext. 5493.
