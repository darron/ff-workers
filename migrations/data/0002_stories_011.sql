Muslim Mass Murderer Gamil Gharbi’s 30th Anniversary
Published December 6, 2019 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Guns
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.
It comes as no surprise to me, nor should it come as one to you, that December 6th is dedicated to hating men when the official Montreal Massacre narrative says all men are responsible for Gamil Gharbi’s actions.
Garbage.
This flies in the face of the facts spelled out by Montreal coroner Teresa Sourour in her report on the murders.
In past years I’ve written about the men who obediently left the room when ordered to do so by the deranged Muslim madman. Not one lifted a finger to stop Gharbi or protect the women who would ultimately fall to his bullets.
If a 17-year-old Boy Scout can take down an armed shooter in a high school classroom in 1998, surely grown men could have taken down Gamil Gharbi in 1989 – but only if they had the backbone of a 15-year-old American Boy Scout, which they clearly did not.
For her part in attempting to talk Gharbi down, Nathalie Provost was shot three times. Miraculously, she survived. Unfortunately, she and others decided all men were to blame for this woman-hater’s crimes.
To this day, she blames guns and legal gun owners because Gharbi had a Firearm Acquisition Certificate (FAC). He purchased his guns and ammunition legally. To these genuinely concerned but deeply misguided people, all gun owners are just “murderers-in-waiting.”
Again, I call bullshit.
The questions Provost and her fellow travelers never ask about the Firearm Acquisition Certificate (FAC) system in place in 1989 are these:
How could the system supposedly designed to prevent this kind of shooting be such a colossal failure?
What police agency investigated Gamil Gharbi and failed to discover the myriad clues to his violent nature that every newspaper in the country found with ease?
Why was nobody ever held responsible for the failure of the FAC system?
Fixing a broken system was never part of their plan.
It was never about holding anyone accountable for the FAC system’s colossal failure, just as it was (and is) never about holding Gharbi accountable for his heinous crimes.
It’s about doing the exact opposite of Marcus Aurelius’ sage advice almost 2,000 years ago.
Punish only he who committed the crime.
No, the annual hate-fest that is December 6th is about punishing everyone except those who committed the crime.
Madness.
I’ve reproduced the conclusion to Investigating Coroner Teresa Z. Sourour’s report below. You can read the entire document in HTML, PDF or DOC thanks to firearm researcher Dennis Young, then assistant to MP Garry Breitkreuz, now a member of the Board of Directors for the Canadian Shooting Sports Association.
For those who have never seen the coroner’s report or even heard of it, for that matter, don’t be surprised. It took 15 years to get it translated into English.
Note Ms. Sourour’s comments about firearms.
Gharbi killed himself long before police even entered the building. He was under no threat from anyone when he ended his own life.

CONCLUSION
As unfortunate as this event was, it was not an exceptional one from the perspective of the emergency services. An armed attack by a single person is, in itself, an event that the SPCUM must deal with on a regular basis.
Nonetheless, we must consider the sixty (60) unused bullets that Marc Lépine left at the scene when he decided to put an end to this terrible episode, although he was in no danger: no police assault was in progress or in any obvious state of preparation. Thank heaven, he decided on his own that enough was enough.
The issue of firearms control has intentionally not been addressed. With the unlimited ammunition and time that Marc Lépine had available to him, he would probably have been able to achieve similar results even with a conventional hunting weapon, which itself is readily accessible. On the other hand, the importance of the questions raised in respect of pre-hospital care and police emergency response are matters that are worthy of our full attention.
The deficiencies identified in relation to the emergency response call for us, in all good conscience, to give them serious thought, not so that we can assign responsibility to anyone in particular, but so that we can take corrective action to ensure that better protection is provided for human life.
Some of the questions stated in the preceding section do not require answers, since the answers are self-evident from the questions. Nonetheless, this does not mean that it is not worth acting on them, even though no formal recommendations are made.
There are numerous other questions, on the other hand, that it would be neither wise nor fair to try to answer without first hearing all of the people involved, particularly since the complexity of some elements means that various experts would have to be heard, and this was not the function of a Coroner’s investigation.

Thank you for posting this factual and unbiased narrative of the actual events. Clearly, this has not communicated by the MSM (ala CBC), and as such used to demonize law abiding gun owners and recently men in general. Yet veterans continue to be kicked to the curb and terrorists rewarded ( or at the very least a willing blind eye turned) by the current government Kudos for calling out the “progressive “ lies and propaganda.

the liberals made all firearms possession in CANADA an illegal, criminal activity, as per “the firearms Act” in the criminal code of Canada, written into law in 1998 as legal monument to the montreal massacre.  The P.A.L. and R.P.AL.firearms licenses are: temporary permit to engage in criminal activity (firearms possession) At the time of inception, libtards said, “don’t be ridiculous! of course we are not going to confiscate your guns!” Fast-forward to today. libtards say ” DONT BE REDICULOUS! OF COURSE WE ARE GOING TO CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS!” They are contemplating cessation of issue of R.P.A.L.’s. in five years all hand guns and restricted class guns would be illegally held, but more likely confiscated and destroyed. Obvously, more guns  would be reclassified as restricted arms. What worked once would work again, when libtards deem appropriate, simply no longer issuing or renewing firearm licenses is their easiest way to civilian disarmament. after all, by libtard decree, all firearm possession in CANADA is a questionable and illegal, criminalized activity.
