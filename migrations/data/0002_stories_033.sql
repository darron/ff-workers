A large crowd stood in complete silence outside an Alberta courthouse Tuesday morning, gathering to support the family of a mother and child that RCMP say were killed by their neighbour last week in a double homicide in Hinton.
The family of 24-year-old Mchale Busch and her 16-month-old son Noah McConnell stood in the middle of the crowd, with a bouquet of flowers and stuffed elephant sitting nearby.A small blue blanket with stars and a moon on it was draped over the shoulder of Cody McConnell, the partner of Mchale Busch and father of Noah. Periodically, he turned his head and kissed it.

Many of those in attendance work with McConnell. Their worksite was shut down for a few hours so employees — clad in their overalls, safety vests and work gear — could attend. Trucks from Midwest Pipelines Inc. were parked nearby.									Story continues below advertisement
Some people exchanged hugs with the family.For more than 15 minutes, the crowd held vigil in complete silence at the Edson courthouse, where the accused was appearing before a judge at a bail hearing on Tuesday.

Police initially were unable to release many details about the homicides, including where the victims’ bodies were found or how they died.On Tuesday, the RCMP provided more information. Investigators believe the victims were killed in Major’s apartment and autopsies conducted over the weekend confirmed both victims’ manner of death were homicide.McConnell called the deaths “100 per cent preventable.”“We need change,” McConnell said while reading a prepared statement. “In honour of Mchale and Noah, we are going to work to elect change to our justice system.”									Story continues below advertisement

McConnell said the justice system failed them, by not letting them know a convicted sex offender — who Alberta Justice says has a criminal record dating back to the early 1990s and has been convicted of sex crimes — lived nearby.“He was free to live in an apartment building filled with children, next to a school and two parks. No one else should ever have to experience the trauma and the violence that we now have to live with forever,” the grief-stricken father said while fighting back tears.“In honour of my wife and my baby boy, we are going to work to make change and save lives. Rest in peace, my babies.”

Upon release in 2017, Edmonton police issued a warning about Major, saying he was being closely monitored by the EPS behavioural assessment unit and investigators had reasonable grounds to believe that Major would “commit another sexual offence against a female, including children, while in the community.”Major was subject to a number of court-ordered conditions, including a curfew and not being allowed to leave Edmonton without written consent.

He was also ordered by the courts to stay away from places where children under the age of 18 were likely to spend time and he was forbidden from purchasing any children’s or women’s undergarments.Major was also banned from owning, viewing or possessing any materials that depict children in “any state of dress, whether it is on paper, video, computer discs, hard drive or any electronic media.”Alberta Justice does maintain a online list of high risk offenders.However, the website says an offender’s information will be removed when they have not been convicted of an offence for 12 months, and are no longer under court-ordered supervision.

Their info will also be removed if their sentence is less than two years or they die.It’s not known how Major came to live in Hinton in the four years since Edmonton police issued the above-mentioned warning, but on Tuesday, the RCMP noted Major had not been subject to any of the conditions of his release since July of 2020.

A GoFundMe has been established to help the family. As of Tuesday morning, more than $53,000 had been raised, far surpassing the goal of $15,000. By Wednesday, the total had increased by $20,000.Major appeared in court via CCTV. His case was put over for a few weeks in order for him to speak with a lawyer. He’ll next appear in Hinton Provincial Court on Oct. 20.									Story continues below advertisement
As the matter is now before the courts, RCMP said it would not be releasing any further information about the investigation.

On October 26, 2021, Ralph Shaw shot and killed two people in the town of Faro, in Canada&#39;s Yukon Territory.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were first alerted to the Faro in order to solve a case of Domestic violence but were then called after residents heard gunfire.[1] On 4:57 PM, RCMP officials placed the entire town into lockdown, eventually rescinding the order after 5:29 PM, issuing a statement to locals that they would still maintain a heavy presence in Faro, .[2] After numerous door-to-door visits the RCMP confirmed that two people, 73 year old town councilor Patrick McCracken and Shaw&#39;s 42-year old estranged wife, Saenduean Honchaiyaphum were killed. One man was critically injured.[1][3][4]
Jack Bowers, who was meant to be sworn in as the town&#39;s new mayor that day, had his date of swearing-in postponed in response.[5] Yukon Premier Sandy Silver condemned the murders that afternoon.[2]

Two people were killed and another injured.Wednesday marks anniversary of incident that left 2 dead and the small Yukon town deeply shakenPaul Tukker  · CBC News  · Posted: Oct 26, 2022 6:24 PM EDT | Last Updated: October 26, 2022People gathered in Faro, Yukon, on Wednesday afternoon for a community fire circle in memory of two people who died in last year&#39;s shooting. (Paul Tukker/CBC)A fresh layer of snow — the season&#39;s first — brightens the landscape during what is an otherwise grim week in Faro, Yukon.It&#39;s been one year since the day the small, quiet community was suddenly thrown into terror and confusion by a gunman on a rampage through town. Two people were killed and another injured.On Wednesday, the community is holding a memorial to remember the deceased victims — Saengduean Honchaiyaphum, 42, and Patrick McCracken, 73.Saengduean Honchaiyaphum, 42 — known to friends as Sang — was married to Ralph Bernard Shaw for 17 years, according to a close friend. She and Patrick McCracken died last year when Shaw went on a shooting rampage in Faro, Yukon. (Sang Honchaiyaphum/Facebook)Their accused killer, Ralph Shaw, was Honchaiyaphum&#39;s estranged husband. Shaw was arrested soon after the shootings and he&#39;s still awaiting trial for murder and attempted murder.&#34;It&#39;s a really hard week for me, for my family, for a lot of people,&#34; said Kara Went, a longtime friend of Honchaiyaphum, as she spoke to CBC on Tuesday in Faro and struggled to hold back tears.&#34;Just a lot of sadness, of missing a friend. It&#39;s just really hard.&#34;Faro is home to fewer than 500 people and so the shootings affected nearly everyone in town, in one way or another. Some residents are still deeply shaken and dealing with lasting trauma, especially those who witnessed the violence or responded in the immediate aftermath that day.Mayor Jack Bowers was a long time friend of McCracken, who had been both a town councillor and the town&#39;s foreman for many years.&#34;I miss him, I miss the conversations that we&#39;d share, and his wisdom,&#34; Bowers said.Patrick McCracken lived in Faro, Yukon. He was killed in the community on Oct. 26, 2021. Ralph Bernard Shaw has been charged with first degree murder in his death. (Brandy Gulle)The mayor acknowledged that the grief is still raw for many people in town, and that some are not yet able to talk about what happened or participate in any sort of memorial. He said the town council talked a lot about whether, and how, to mark Wednesday&#39;s anniversary of the event.&#34;We really weren&#39;t sure how we should remember [the victims] and in what fashion that should be done,&#34; he said.&#34;For some [residents], they&#39;ll need a release, and coming together to share a few tears is maybe what&#39;s healthy and what&#39;s needed. For others, things are still too raw and they won&#39;t be able to come. So we&#39;re respectful of that, and trying to meet a need that we perceive is in the community.&#34;On Wednesday afternoon, there is a memorial fire at a gathering place near the school. In the evening, there&#39;s a community potluck at the rec centre. &#34;There is a healing process, and I think that we&#39;re going through that now,&#34; Bowers said.Jack Bowers is the mayor of Faro, Yukon. (Paul Tukker/CBC)&#39;Just still trying to see the good&#39;Went and her family have been going through their own healing process. Over the years, they&#39;ve typically all been deeply involved in their community as volunteers with different activities and groups. That changed after the shootings, Went said.&#34;Honestly, over the past year, I felt like our family pulled inwards, like we let go of all of our volunteer commitments and just focused on healing our family,&#34; she said.&#34;Getting a lot of counselling, and just still trying to see the good.&#34;In the weeks after the shootings, Went became a vocal advocate for more mental health and counselling services for her community. She feels those efforts ultimately paid off — with some effort — as there is now a counsellor based in Faro more regularly. This week, the Yukon government has also sent additional mental wellness and victims services&#39; counsellors to be on hand in town.&#34;I think it just takes so long for anyone to process it. Like, it&#39;s only been a year and sometimes it feels like it was a week ago,&#34; Went said.Kara Went, a longtime friend of Saengduean Honchaiyaphum, said her family has been going through their own healing process since the shooting in Faro, Yukon, last year that took her friend&#39;s life. (Paul Tukker/CBC)&#34;I can&#39;t really judge how the community feels. I know my family is still really hurting but thanks to the counselling I feel like we&#39;re making a lot of progress on that — and I hope a lot of families are too.&#34;She&#39;s still reluctant to talk much about her friend Honchaiyaphum and how she died. She feels deeply protective of the privacy of Honchaiyaphum&#39;s two daughters, who are still in Faro.But she&#39;s eager to sing the praises of her community. The local population has been growing again in recent years and young families are moving to town. Went said there&#39;s a new energy in Faro, with lots of activity at the school and a rec centre that&#39;s &#34;hopping all the time.&#34; The recreation centre in Faro, Yukon, where a community potluck will be held Wednesday evening in remembrance of Saengduean Honchaiyaphum and Patrick McCracken. (Paul Tukker/CBC)&#34;I think that brings back that feeling of yeah, we are a community, and one person can&#39;t ruin … can&#39;t take that away from us,&#34; she said.Recovering a sense of safetyLarry Baran, the town&#39;s chief administrative officer, agrees. He and his wife lived in Faro years ago and decided to move back earlier this year because they loved the community so much. They arrived just a few months after the shootings. What Baran&#39;s seen and heard since then has only deepened his feelings for Faro. Nestled in a beautiful part of the Yukon, Faro saw the season&#39;s first snow this week as community members prepared to mark a sombre anniversary. (Paul Tukker/CBC)&#34;I love and respect the way the community has pulled together,&#34; Baran said.&#34;I&#39;m very proud of the people that responded and the way that they did. They responded more as friends than as emergency responders. They were there. Some of them are still suffering, and my heart goes out to them.&#34;Baran said the incident was so shocking because it threatened to undermine what many people in Faro felt about their small town, and almost took for granted: a sense of safety, and friendship among neighbours.  That&#39;s slowly coming back, he said.3 months after deadly shootings, grief and trauma linger in Faro, YukonDeadly shootings revealed &#39;community of heroes,&#39; says mayor of Faro, YukonBowers, the town&#39;s mayor, is also keen to ensure Faro is not defined by tragedy, though he acknowledged that what happened a year ago is &#34;going to be a mark on us for some time.&#34;&#34;There&#39;s so much about Faro that is so good … We don&#39;t want folks to remember Faro just for this incident. Remember us for those good things that we&#39;re all very proud of,&#34; he said.ABOUT THE AUTHORPaul TukkerSenior writerPaul Tukker is a writer and reporter with CBC News in Whitehorse.

Four deaths in Richmond, B.C., believed to be a murder-suicide, police say
RICHMOND, B.C. — Homicide investigators say they believe the targeted shooting that left four people dead in a Richmond, B.C., home was a murder-suicide.

RICHMOND, B.C. — Homicide investigators say they believe the targeted shooting that left four people dead in a Richmond, B.C., home was a murder-suicide.
The victims were all members of the same family and include a 71-year-old father, a 58-year-old mother, their 23-year-old son and a daughter, aged 21.
Sgt. David Lee of the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team says the shootings do not appear to be a case of partner violence and that the son had a firearms licence and access to weapons.
Lee says investigators are looking through journals and social media posts to see if they can determine a possible motive for the deaths.
The shootings were discovered Tuesday after a neighbour called police to report that the lights in the home had been left on for an unusual amount of time.
Police have said they believe the shooting happened Monday evening.
Lee says investigators are still interviewing witnesses and are asking anyone who was in the area on Jan. 24 or has information to contact the homicide team.
&#34;We&#39;re combing through evidence. It&#39;s difficult to determine how much we have.&#34;
He says determining who was the shooter through firearms ballistics could take weeks, if not months.
&#34;At this stage, preliminary findings suggest that one of the family members was the shooter,&#34; police say in a news release. &#34;(Homicide) investigators have followed the evidence, starting with a search warrant without presumptions on motive or responsibility.&#34;
This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 28, 2022.
