Supreme Court in Vancouver.Matthew James Johnston and Cody Rae Haevischer are charged with six counts of first-degree murder and Quang Vinh Thang (Michael) Le is facing one charge of first-degree murder.Two other men charged in the case, Jamie Kyle Bacon and Sophon Sek, will be tried separately at a later date.Prosecutors say they intend to prove that Johnston and Haevischer went to the apartment to kill victim Corey Lal because he failed to meet a deadline to repay a $100,000 drug debt.They say the accused killed the other five people in the apartment so there would be no witnesses to the murder of Lal.Prosecutors said the six bodies were found in two groups of three inside the apartment. A total of 19 shots were fired in the massacre, which took place around 2:40 p.m. PT on Oct. 19, 2007.The six all had their heads covered and shots were fired directly into the backs of the heads of three of the victims. One other was shot in the back, another in the head, and one in the face and neck.The three accused were all members of the Red Scorpions gang, the Crown said.But only two, Johnston and Haevischer, are charged with the first-degree murders of two victims — Christopher Mohan, 22, and Ed Schellenberg, 55 — whom police have described as bystanders who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.A grieving motherOutside the courthouse, Eileen Mohan, whose son Christopher was killed, spoke to reporters before the trial began Monday morning.&#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for five years and 11 months. And I&#39;m so glad that the day has finally come,” she said.Inside, Mohan took a front-row seat for the trial where the Crown laid out its case by showing graphic photographs of two groups of three men, their heads covered, lying face down on the floor.Mohan said she quickly turned away after catching a glance of the photograph of her son&#39;s body.Later, Mohan told reporters outside the courthouse that it was difficult seeing those photos.&#34;I looked once and then I looked away,&#34; she said.&#34;I want to remember my son the way he was. Not in this state.… in blood amongst strangers that he never knew … and people that he never should have died with,” she said.6 victims found dead in highriseFirst responders found six men dead in a 15th floor apartment suite in the 9800 block of East Whalley Ring Road.Read more about the slayingsAn RCMP cruiser blocks the road leading to an apartment building in Surrey, B.C., on Oct. 20, 2007. Firefighters, who were first on the scene, initially thought they were responding to a deadly gas leak. When they arrived, they found the bodies of six men killed in a bloody massacre. (Richard Lam/Canadian Press)Firefighters, who were first on the scene, initially thought they were responding to a deadly gas leak, but when they arrived, they found the bodies of the six men.At the time, Metro Vancouver was in the grips of a violent gang war dominated by a deadly rivalry between the Red Scorpions and the UN gangs.Four of the victims, Ryan Bartolomeo,19, brothers Michael Lal, 26, and Cory Lal, 21, and Edward Narong, 22, were described by police as having criminal lifestyles.Mohan and Schellenberg were described as bystanders who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.In April 2009, a man pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree murder for killing Mohan, Bartolomeo and Michael Lal, and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder in the six slayings, and was sentenced to life in prison.Jamie Bacon has been charged with one count of first-degree murder in the death of Corey Lal and conspiracy to murder charges.Sophon Sek is facing a manslaughter charge.In addition, four RCMP officers are facing charges, including breach of trust, obstruction of justice and fraud, dating back to their handling of the Surrey Six slayings.B.C.&#39;s criminal justice branch appointed Victoria lawyer Christopher Considine as a special prosecutor in the investigation of the officers.Crown spokeswoman Samantha Hulme said the trial is expected to take one year as the judge hears from as many as 100 witnesses.CBC&#39;s Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

The Supreme Court of Canada has rejected an attempt by triple-murderer Jesse Imeson to appeal a lower court decision that called into question claims that childhood sexual abuse contributed to his lethal behaviour as an adult.Imeson was found guilty of killing three people in Southwestern Ontario in the summer of 2007.On July 19, he strangled 25-year-old Carlos Rivera, a Windsor bartender. Four days later the bodies of Bill and Helene Regier, who had been shot to death, were found in their farmhouse near Grand Bend, northwest of London.Slain Ont. couple were &#39;pillars of the community&#39;: familyIn October 2008, Imeson, then 23, pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years.Bill and Helene Regier were shot in their farmhouse on July 23, 2007. ((Canadian Press))While in prison in 2009, Imeson alleged that he had been sexually assaulted by Tony &#34;Doe&#34;, a former child and youth worker with Maryvale Adolescent and Family Services in Windsor.In 1996-1997, Imeson spent a few months at the residential institution, which cares for troubled youth.He also alleged that about a year after leaving Maryvale and while in foster care, he was sexually abused by Father Howarth, a now deceased priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of London.In September, 2016, a jury found Maryvale vicariously liable for sexual assaults allegedly committed against Imeson by &#34;Doe&#34;. Chronology leading to SCC decisionThe jury did not accept Imeson&#39;s claim that he was also sexually abused by the deceased priest, and the action against the Roman Catholic Diocese of London was dismissed.During that trial, Imeson sought to call Dr. Kerry Smith, a mental health clinician employed in the British Columbia prison system who had seen and counselled Imeson over a long series of therapeutic sessions.Lawyers for Maryvale tried to block Dr. Smith&#39;s evidence on the grounds that he lacked the necessary training and expertise to give an opinion on childhood sexual abuse. But the trial judge ruled Smith was qualified to provide &#34;expert opinion with respect to certain issues.&#34;The Ontario Court of Appeal ruled in 2018 that Smith&#39;s opinions did not qualify as expert evidence and that the trial judge erred by allowing it to be heard.As a result, the court ordered a new civil trial between Imeson and Maryvale.Imeson&#39;s attempt to appeal that ruling was rejected Thursday by the Supreme Court of Canada. The high court gave no reason for its decision, as is standard practice.           CBC&#39;s Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

The Shafia family murders took place on June 30, 2009, in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Shafia sisters Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, and Geeti, 13, along with their father&#39;s wife Rona Muhammad Omar, 52 (all of Afghan origin), were found dead inside a car that was discovered underwater in front of the northernmost Kingston Mills lock of the Rideau Canal.[1] Zainab, Sahar, and Geeti were daughters of Mohammad Shafia, 58, and his wife, Tooba Mohammad Yahya, 41. The couple also had a son, Hamed, 20, and three other children. Rona, who was herself infertile, was the first wife of Mohammad Shafia in their polygamous household.
On July 23, 2009, Mohammad, Tooba Yahya, and Hamed were arrested on charges of four counts of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder under the guise of honour killing.[2][3] The jury found them guilty of all four counts in January 2012. The trial, which took place at the Frontenac County Court House, was believed to be the first in Canada conducted in four languages – English, French, Dari and Spanish.[4]
The trial garnered media attention in Canada for several months and raised the debate over Canadian values, honour crimes, and violence among Muslim groups.
Background[edit]
In 1979 or 1980, Mohammad Shafia married Rona Mohammed. The couple did not have children, and medical tests confirmed that Rona was unable to have children. In keeping with Afghan custom, and at Rona&#39;s behest, Mohammad Shafia took Tooba Yahya as his second wife. The second wedding took place in 1989, and Rona features prominently in many wedding photographs, many of which feature Shafia flanked by his two wives.[5] The three of them lived together in one household, as is customary, and Tooba gave birth to seven children. Rona participated fully in raising and caring for the children and bonded strongly with them as though they were her own. Her relationship with her co-wife, however, was less idyllic.[5]
The Shafia family left Afghanistan in 1992. They moved to Australia for a brief time. Later, they relocated to the United Arab Emirates, where they lived for over a decade. Mohammad Shafia made a considerable fortune in Dubai, working in the used car business and later diversifying into real estate.[6] By 2007, he was a multimillionaire. He soon decided to take advantage of an immigration program introduced by the government of Quebec in Canada which offered permanent residence and eventual citizenship to people who invested significant money in the province. Shafia invested $2 million in purchasing a strip-mall on the outskirts of Montreal; he invested a further $200,000 in building a spacious new house for his family. Shafia, his second wife Tooba, and their seven children immigrated to Canada and settled in the Saint-Léonard borough of Montreal in 2007.[7][8] Five months later, Shafia sponsored Rona&#39;s immigration, telling authorities that she was his cousin and that she would work as a cook and housekeeper.[9][10][11]
According to a family member&#39;s interview, Rona was trapped in an abusive, loveless marriage, trying in vain to convince her husband to grant her a divorce. Rona&#39;s siblings claimed that she feared for her life during the days leading up to her death.[12] Tooba allegedly said to Rona, &#34;You are a slave; you are a servant.&#34;  Reportedly, the Shafias held all of Rona&#39;s identity documents, including her passport, so Rona believed she could not flee to another country where she had relatives.[9] The Montreal Gazette reported that Rona emigrated to Canada as a domestic servant on a visitor&#39;s visa and that her husband and co-wife &#34;held [the visa&#39;s renewal] over her head like an axe ready to fall.&#34;[13]
The interviewed family member also stated that the Shafia family&#39;s eldest daughter, Zainab, was in a relationship with a Pakistani boy that elicited much anger from her father; the family member claimed to have overheard the father&#39;s threats to kill Zainab.[14]
With Mohammad Shafia, Tooba Mohammad Yahya, and their eldest son Hamed Shafia all in custody during the trial, the remaining Shafia children, two girls, and a boy, were being cared for under social services.[6]
Investigation[edit]
On June 30, 2009, a worker at the Kingston Mills locks discovered a black Nissan Sentra with a broken left taillight submerged in the water. Divers discovered four female bodies floating inside.[15] Mohammad Shafia was at the Kingston Police station to report that four of his family members – three teenage daughters and a purported aunt – were missing.[8] Police initially believed that it was a tragic, if bizarre, accident; they first categorized it as a &#34;sudden death investigation.&#34;[15]
However, authorities soon learned that Hamed had reported an accident with the family Lexus SUV in an empty parking lot earlier that same morning in Montreal. Despite their suspicions, authorities did not have &#34;reasonable and probable grounds&#34; or sufficient evidence to ask a judge for a search warrant. Kingston Police Det. Steve Koopman, the liaison with the Shafia family, managed to gain the Shafia family&#39;s consent to view the Lexus. After assessing the damage on both vehicles, police theorized that the Lexus was used to ram the Nissan into the locks.[16]
It had been reported that the Shafia family purchased the used Nissan Sentra for CAD $5,000 on the day prior to the family leaving Montreal for Niagara Falls.[17]
Trial[edit]
Jury selection began on October 11, 2011, and the trial officially began on October 20th the same year.[18] Ontario Superior Court Judge Robert Maranger presided over the trial.[19]
Verdict[edit]
On January 29, 2012, after 15 hours of deliberation, a jury found each of the three defendants guilty of four counts of first-degree murder. In Canada, first-degree murder verdicts carry an automatic sentence of life without the possibility of parole for 25 years.[20]
Media coverage of the Shafia murder trial[edit]
The coverage of the Shafia murder trial was widespread, often being on the front page of newspapers and the top story in TV newscasts. Since the case involved Afghan Canadians, questions arose as to whether or not it was correct, or even appropriate, to call the murders honour killings or simply domestic violence. While the judge who presided over the case referred to the deaths simply as murders, the media chose a different course when it called the murders &#34;honour killings.&#34; Across media outlets, the murder was framed as such. A publication ban placed on the case prevented the media from naming the three surviving children in the care of Canadian social services.
CBC[edit]
CBC News covered the trials extensively from the first day; they went a step further by publishing its audience&#39;s comments to show how Canadians felt about the case and its details. The CBC stated that the published comments were a chosen representative &#34;summary&#34; sampling out of the much higher number of comments the story garnered, and moreover that Canadians generally &#34;agreed with the verdict, applauding the court and the jury for its decision after the three-month trial.&#34;[21]
CTV[edit]
CTV News published a piece stating that the trial cast a shadow over Canada&#39;s Islamic community, further tarnishing an image that had not yet recovered from the events of 9/11. However, like other media outlets, CTV asked the Muslim community to clarify their stance on the issue of honour killing: &#34;Muslims across the country, however, say the revelations in a Kingston, Ont., courtroom have shone a light on problematic aspects of their culture and illuminated new ways to tackle the issues.&#34;[22]
CTV also published a timeline spanning the gamut from the Shafia family&#39;s days in Afghanistan to the events that took place in Canada.[23]
Ottawa Citizen[edit]
Pascale Fournier, writing for The Ottawa Citizen, said that there was a greater tragedy in the failure of the state to intervene before the murders occurred. He also said that while vulnerable groups from immigrant communities need the most protection, they rarely receive it from authorities.[24]
The Globe and Mail[edit]
In addition to covering every detail of the trial, The Globe and Mail published a piece with the &#34;ten most shocking quotes&#34; from the Shafia trial. One of the quotes was by Crown attorney Gerard Laarhuis after the verdicts, and it read as follows:
&#34;This jury found that four strong, vivacious and freedom-loving women were murdered by their own family in the most troubling of circumstances. We all think of these four wonderful women now who died needless deaths. This verdict sends a very clear message about our Canadian values and the core principles in a free and democratic society that both Canadians and visitors to Canada enjoy.&#34;[22][25][better source needed]
This was one of the most criticized quotes by Afghan Canadians; they asserted that intolerance towards violence against women is not just a Canadian value, but a universal value. They also asserted that Afghans, like any other peoples, condemn the acts of the perpetrators.[citation needed]
Montreal Gazette[edit]
The Montreal Gazette published a column in which it said that labelling the murders as honour killing is a mistake as domestic violence against women is ubiquitous and framing it as a particular paradigm would mean distancing oneself from a crime that is all too common. The authors argue that premeditation is put forth as a core component to differentiate honour killings from other types of murders, such as crimes of convenience or passion. However, recent studies indicate that premeditation is as much a component in other cases of domestic violence and murder as it is in &#34;honour killings&#34;.
&#34;Calling the murders &#39;honour killings&#39; accomplishes two goals. First, it makes it seem as if femicide is a highly unusual event. Second, it makes it seem as if femicide is confined to specific populations within Canada and specific national cultures or religions in the world at large. But Canadian statistics prove otherwise. According to StatsCan figures, from 2000 to 2009 an average of 58 women a year were killed in this country as a result of spousal violence. In that same period, 67 children and young people aged 12 to 17 were murdered by family members. In contrast, recent estimates tell us that there have been 12 or 13 so-called honour killings in Canada in the last decade. It does not take a genius to see that comparing 12 or 13 against the hundreds of women and children who were victims of familial violence serves only to frame &#39;honour killing&#39; as peculiar, when in reality it is part of a larger pattern of violence against women.&#34;[26]
Maclean&#39;s[edit]
Maclean&#39;s referred to the four murders as &#34;honouricide.&#34; Writer Michael Friscolanti sat throughout the three-month trial and wrote a 22-page comprehensive article detailing the girls&#39; lives and even wrote about how one of the girls&#39; tombstones has the incorrect birthdate.
&#34;In life, and in death, they had no voice,&#34; Friscolanti wrote. &#34;No one to save them. No one who even cares enough to fix Geeti&#39;s headstone. Nearly three years after she was buried, it is still engraved with Sahar&#39;s birth-date, not hers.&#34;[27]
Reaction[edit]
Muslims in Canada[edit]
The murders gave rise to the debate about the relationship between honour killing and Islam. Islamic organizations based in Canada condemned the murders. The Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, along with other Canadian Muslim organizations, have publicly denounced domestic violence and honour killing as un-Islamic.[28] Ali Falih Altaie, the family imam, said that the murders were unforgivable; he also cautioned against associating honour crimes with Islam, calling the actions incompatible with any religion.[29][30]
In 2012 imams from across Canada and the U.S. issued a moral ruling officially condemning honour killings, domestic violence, and misogyny as un-Islamic. Thirty-four imams belonging to the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, including a handful of American members, signed the fatwa in an effort to counter misinterpretations of the Qur&#39;an.[31]
Afghan Canadians[edit]
In an interview with CTVS News, the Afghan Embassy in Ottawa condemned the murders of the four members of the Shafia family. The embassy called the deaths of the three teenage sisters and their father&#39;s first wife a heinous crime against humanity. Moreover, they claimed that this kind of crime is not part of Afghan or Islamic culture and is not acceptable in any way.[32]
