2020 Stabbing spree attack
2020 Quebec City Halloween stabbingLocationQuebec City, Quebec, CanadaDate31 October 2020 (2020-10-31) c. 10:30 p.m. (UTC-4:00)TargetPassers-byAttack typeMass stabbingWeaponsJapanese sword[1]Deaths2Injured5AccusedCarl Girouard
On 31 October 2020, two people were stabbed to death and 5 others injured near the Parliament Building in the Old Quebec neighbourhood of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.[1][2][3] The perpetrator, 24-year-old Carl Girouard, was arrested immediately following the attack.[4][5]
Incident[edit]
On the night of Halloween 2020, at about 10:30 p.m. local time, a man dressed in a medieval costume carried out a mass stabbing in Quebec City, attacking people with a katana-style saber near the provincial legislature, the National Assembly of Quebec. The victims were chosen at random. Two people were killed, Suzanne Clermont, a 61-year-old woman and François Duchesne, a 56-year-old man,[6] and five others were injured.
Suspect[edit]
Carl Girouard, a 24-year-old man from Sainte-Thérèse on Montreal&#39;s North Shore, was arrested.[7][8] The police reported that the attacker was prepared to inflict as much damage as possible, and had gasoline containers in his car. The man was not affiliated with any terror group, according to police, but his motivations are unknown.[9][10] Police said that the man had, five years prior, expressed to a doctor threats to perform similar actions.[8][11]
On 18 June 2021, Prosecutor François Godin filed a direct indictment, with Girouard set to go directly to trial without a preliminary hearing.[12]
On 20 May 2022, after five days of deliberation, Carl Girouard was convicted of the first degree murders of François Duchesne and Suzanne Clermont. He faced life in prison with no possibility of parole within the next 25 years.[13]

Three bodies were found on June 13, 2020, in or near a home on Langley’s Wakefield Drive. Kia Ebrahimian was later charged with second degree murder in the death of three family members. (Langley Advance Times files)
Trial in Langley triple-murder case not expected until next fall
Jury selection is scheduled for September 2022
Matthew ClaxtonOct. 26, 2021 5:50 a.m.Local NewsNews
It will be the fall of 2022 at the earliest before the man accused of a triple homicide in Langley goes on trial.
Kia Ebrahimian is charged with second degree murder in the deaths of his sibling, mother, and step-father. He is due back in B.C. Supreme Court in New Westminster for an appearance on November 18, but jury selection for a trial has been scheduled for September of next year, according to the court registry.
Jury selection typically takes place shortly before a trial begins.
On June 13, 2020, Medea ‘Befrin’ Ebrahimian, their mother Tatiana Bazyar, and Bazyar’s common-law husband Francesco Zangrilli were all found dead at or near the scene of a house fire in the 19600 block of Wakefield Drive in the Langley Meadows neighbourhood.
Kia Ebrahimian, Befrin’s brother, was charged with murder a month later. He was 24 when he was first charged in the summer of 2020.
If convicted, Ebrahimian would face life in prison, with a parole eligibility of between 10 and 25 years, determined by the judge.
Ebrahimian has made several court appearances over the summer and fall of last year. Details of a bail hearing in the case are covered by a publication ban.
Persons charged with criminal offences are considered not guilty until the charges are proven in court.

RCMP were dispatched to this Langley house after a non-emergency police call turned into a plea for help on June 13, 2020. On Tuesday, Sept. 20, the trial of Kia Ebrahimian got underway. He is charged with the deaths of his brother Befrin Ebrahimian, their mother Tatiana Bazyar, and Bazyar’s common-law husband Francesco Zangrilli. (Langley Advance Times file)
Killer changes plea to guilty in triple murder of Langley family
Kia Ebrahimian has pleaded guilty to killing his brother, mother, and step-father
Matthew ClaxtonOct. 4, 2022 4:30 p.m.News
A Langley man has pleaded guilty to three counts of second degree murder in the slaying of his family members mid-way through his trial.
Kia Ebrahimian entered three guilty pleas on Monday, Oct. 3, according to the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT). His trial had already been underway for two weeks, after he initially attempted to plead not guilty.
Ebrahimian’s lawyer had admitted most of the facts of the case – that Ebrahimian was responsible for the deaths of his sibling, Befrin Ebrahimian, their mother, Tatiana Bazyar, and Bazyar’s common-law husband, Francesco Zangrilli.
At issue was whether Kia was a “rational actor, who was able to form the intent of murder,” Crown prosecutor Michael Fortino said on the opening day of the trial.
The murders appear to have been sparked by a conflict between Ebrahimian and Befrin, who was a transgender man who had completed gender reassignment surgery, according to Fortino.
Ebrahimian and his brother had been clashing since Ebrahimian had moved back into the house in the spring of 2020.
On June 13 of that year, the house in the 19600 block of Wakefield Drive caught fire.
Emergency responders and police investigators would later discover the bodies of the rest of the family. Fortino told the court that they had died of “sharp force injuries.”
An emergency call by Zangrilli was played on the first day of the trial, in which he suddenly called for help, a voice could be heard screaming in the background, and a fire alarm went off.
By the time officers arrived, the house was ablaze. Police forced their way in and managed to find Zangrilli, who died of his stab wounds. Bayzar and Befrin were not found until the fire was extinguished.
Ebrahimian had escaped the fire on a ladder. Knives found on him had DNA from his brother and step-father, the court heard.

A sentencing hearing for Ebrahimian will be held in December.
Because he has pleaded guilty to murder, he will be sentenced automatically to life in prison. In cases of second-degree murder, the judge can set minimum parole eligibility at anywhere between 10 and 25 years, depending on the circumstances and severity of the case.

On June 6, 2021, a man rammed a pickup truck into Muslim Pakistani Canadian pedestrians at an intersection in London, Ontario, Canada.[1] Four people were killed and a fifth was wounded; all were from the same family.[2] Police say the attack was motivated by Islamophobia.[3][1] The attack was the deadliest mass killing in London&#39;s history.[4] It was condemned by Canadian leaders, and called terrorism by Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan and Premier of Ontario Doug Ford.[5][6] The suspect was charged with four counts of terroristic murder and one count of terroristic attempted murder.
Attack[edit]
At about 8:40 pm on June 6, 2021, a man mounted a curb and drove his pickup truck into five members of a family. According to police, this attack was intentional,[7] and motivated by anti-Muslim hatred.[3] The attack took place at the intersection of Hyde Park Road and South Carriage Road in London&#39;s Hyde Park neighbourhood, where the family had been waiting to cross. A witness described being stopped at a red light when the truck sped past her, shaking her car from the force.[8] One woman was pronounced dead at the scene, and the others were rushed to a hospital, three of them later succumbed to their wounds.[9]
Shortly before 9:00 pm, a black pickup truck approached a cab parked at Cherryhill Village Mall, about 7 km (4.3 mi) away from the attack.[8] The driver of the truck, 20-year-old Nathaniel Veltman, approached the cab driver, said that he had just killed someone and asked the cabbie to call the police. Speaking on behalf of the traumatized driver, Yellow Taxi London president Hassan Savehilaghi described Veltman as wearing a military-style helmet and a bullet-proof vest which may have been tagged with swastikas, and the truck was covered with blood. Savehilaghi&#39;s description was corroborated by a mall maintenance worker who also witnessed the arrest. The driver called 9-1-1 and waved down a passing police cruiser. Veltman allegedly laughed as he was arrested, and asked the driver to film it.[10]
Victims[edit]
The five victims were all from the same family and Muslims; most arrived in Canada from Pakistan in 2007.[1] The dead were a 46-year-old husband, his 44-year-old wife, their 15-year-old daughter and his 74-year-old mother.[11] The only survivor, the family&#39;s 9-year-old boy was seriously injured.[9] On June 14, a family friend said he was out of the hospital.[12]
Accused[edit]
By June 7, Nathaniel Veltman was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.[13] The London Police Service believe he planned the attack in advance.[14] He was wearing a body-armour-style vest at the time of his arrest,[15] and might have participated in an airsoft shooting game that evening before the collision.[10] He had no previous connection to the victims[16] or known ties to hate groups.[17]
Veltman worked at an egg-packing facility in Strathroy and lived in an apartment on Covent Market Place in downtown London.[17] One friend and co-worker who was raised as a Muslim described him as a proud Christian, and noted he seemed to treat Muslims normally for the four years he worked there.[18] Co-workers said the alleged murders and motivation seemed out-of-character and unexpected, one denying Veltman is a radical terrorist or Islamophobe.[10]
During Veltman&#39;s parents&#39; divorce in 2016, he was described as &#34;peculiar and challenging&#34;, and both agreed he should continue therapy and be supervised around his younger siblings.[19]
Legal proceedings[edit]
Shortly after the attack, Crown attorneys charged Veltman with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. He made a court appearance on June 10, without a lawyer, so was given time to find one. On June 14, the charges were all upgraded to include terrorism, and the court adjourned until June 21. Many details of the case are under a publication ban.[20]
Reactions[edit]
The House of Commons held a moment of silence for the victims.[5] The attack was condemned by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,[5] the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi,[21] the National Council of Canadian Muslims[13] and Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan[22] all of whom called it an act of terrorism motivated by hatred. All parties in the Canadian parliament agreed to call &#34;an emergency national action summit to tackle Islamophobia.&#34;[23]
A vigil was held on June 8, at the London Muslim Mosque. Premier of Ontario Doug Ford temporarily lifted provincial COVID-19 restrictions in London for it to proceed.[24] Trudeau, Ford and London mayor Ed Holder attended, among thousands more.[25] On June 12, a public funeral was held with hundreds in attendance.[26]
In June 2022, the city of London and other organizations organized an event in honour of those killed as well as to generate awareness about Islamophobia.[27] Over 1000 people attended the event, including Prime Minister Trudeau.[28]
