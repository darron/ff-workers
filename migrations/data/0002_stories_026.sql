Clarence Haryett, also known by his DJ name “C-Dog,” took the witness stand all day Sept. 9 and was the fourteenth Crown witness to testify during the first-degree murder trial of Edward James Penner. (Crystal Schick/Yukon News file)
Edward Penner murder trial hears from driver
Clarence Haryett testified that the suspect and victim got out of his car, but only Penner returned
Jackie HongSep. 11, 2019 12:00 p.m.Local NewsNews
A Whitehorse man told a jury Sept. 9 that two men he knew as “Tanner” and “Adam” got out of his car in late June 2017, but, after he heard a single shot, only one came back.
Clarence Haryett, also known by his DJ name “C-Dog,” took the witness stand all day Monday, the fourteenth Crown witness to testify during the first-degree murder trial of Edward James Penner.
Penner, a 22-year-old from British Columbia, is accused of killing Adam Cormack, 25. Cormack’s body was found on a dirt road off the Alaska Highway in Ibex Valley on June 28, 2017.
Haryett confirmed to Crown attorney Tom Lemon that he occasionally does “sober driving,” in which he basically serves as a private taxi service, and was doing so in June 2017.
He also confirmed that he was arrested for Cormack’s murder last December. However, he wasn’t charged and police released him after he gave a statement about driving Tanner, Cormack and a man named Bubbles about 20 minutes out of town to a spot off the Alaska Highway.
Haryett gave a police statement in November 2017 in which he claimed he didn’t know Cormack and knew nothing related to the murder.
“Did you murder Adam Cormack?” Lemon asked.
“No, I did not,” Haryett responded.
Asked if he saw Tanner in the courtroom, Haryett pointed at Penner.
Haryett testified that he had driven Tanner “a couple of times,” including to get off-sales.
One trip to the Airport Chalet was caught on security camera.
The video was date-stamped as June 27, 2017; Haryett said he had driven Tanner and Bubbles from a house party in Hillcrest to the Airport Chalet and back, but didn’t remember what else he did that night.
After being shown a photo by the Crown, Haryett confirmed that he had been to the area where Cormack’s body was found, testifying that he had driven Tanner, Cormack and Bubbles there.
While they came from the house in Hillcrest, Haryett said he couldn’t remember when they left or what time of day it was.
He testified that he driven there because his passengers said they wanted to smoke a joint.
Haryett said that his passengers got out of his car, and Cormack, who he only knew by first name, and Tanner walked up a trail.
Tanner had a gun, Haryett said, and after the men were out of sight, he heard a single shot.
About a minute later, Tanner returned to the car saying, “We gotta go.”
Haryett agreed that he wondered what had happened to Cormack, but didn’t ask any questions.
Haryett said the last time he drove Tanner was in late June 2017, when he gave Tanner, Bubbles, and two women named Justine and Juanita a ride from the Hillcrest to the Family Hotel.
He confirmed that he registered a room under his name for them because he was the only one with ID.
Defence lawyer Andre Ouellette challenged Haryett’s credibility during a lengthy cross-examination.
He suggested that Haryett was “tricked” by police into pinning the blame for Cormack’s death on Penner, noting that a police officer told Haryett after his arrest that Penner was already charged with murder and was brought up from British Columbia for “enforcement.”
Haryett confirmed that, at the time, he had recently regained custody of his son, and agreed that staying out of jail to keep his son was the most important thing.
Ouellette suggested Haryett blamed Tanner in order to save himself.
The lawyer also questioned whether Haryett had deeper ties to drug users and dealers than he was letting on, and asked if he had been helping Tanner or others run drugs.
Haryett denied that.
As well, Ouellette pushed Haryett on how he couldn’t remember seeing Tanner’s gun at any point before or after he walked up the trail with Cormack, and why he had lied to police in his first statement.
The court also heard from two witnesses on Sept. 10 ⁠— forensic pathologist Jason Morin, who conducted Cormack’s autopsy, and Yukon RCMP Const. Emma Leslie, who examined Facebook messages to and from an account under the name of “James Tanner.”
Morin testified that based on the autopsy, which took place in Vancouver of June 30, 2017, Cormack died from the gunshot wound to his head with no other factors contributing to his death.
Based on the gun-powder stippling around the entrance wound and the trajectory of the bullet, Morin said the gun was an “intermediate” distance from Cormack’s head ⁠— about two to three feet, roughly ⁠— and pointing down slightly when the bullet was fired.
Morin said that the fractures in Cormack’s skull as well as damage to soft neck tissue caused him to believe that Cormack was probably shot with a high-power firearm, although he confirmed in cross-examination it was impossible to tell if the gun was a powerful handgun or a rifle.
He also testified that gunshot wounds to the head typically do not result in much bleeding.
Leslie, meanwhile, took the jury through a tome of printed-out Facebook messages between “James Tanner” and at least six other people.
Messages from the Tanner account dating from June 9 to 26, 2017, say, among other things, that the person using the account is “Penner;” that he’s in Whitehorse or travelling to Whitehorse; and that he obtained a “full auto” AR-15 for $2,500.
Leslie testified that based on the account’s profile photo, as well as photos sent in the messages, she believed “James Tanner” was Penner.
She agreed with defence lawyer Kelly Labine, though, that while the messages were sent from the “James Tanner” account, there was no way to tell who wrote the messages.
The trial continues.

Legal advisor appointed to consider appeal of murder verdict
Sentenced to life for shooting death in Whitehorse, former Quesnel man Edward James Penner filed an appeal but is now refusing to participate

A former Quesnel man now serving a life sentence for a murder in Whitehorse, Yukon, has been appointed an amicus after refusing to follow through on an appeal of his conviction.
An amicus is an impartial legal advisor asked to take part in a specific case. In September 2019, a jury found then 22-year-old Edward James Penner guilty of first-degree murder in the July 2017 shooting death of Adam Cormack, 27, whose body was found on a dirt road near a gravel pit north of Whitehorse.
Sentenced to life without eligibility for parole for 25 years, Penner filed an appeal roughly a month later. He was appointed legal counsel from the Yukon Legal Services Society who, in turn, filed transcripts and an appeal book with the court.
But Penner has since dismissed the counsel and has not been attending case management proceedings. The matter was then referred to the Yukon Court of Appeal for Justices to decide whether to dismiss the appeal.
In a decision issued May 17, a panel of three judges agreed to keep the matter before the court while appointing an amicus to review the merits of the appeal whether Penner &#34;actively participates or not.&#34;
&#34;In my view, it is not yet appropriate to dismiss this appeal for want of prosecution. Mr. Penner has been convicted of a most serious offence and faces the most significant sentence known to our law. In the circumstances I have outlined, at least one further accommodation must be afforded Mr. Penner,&#34; Chief Justice Robert Bauman wrote in the decision.
According to a summary of the previous counsel&#39;s submissions on the merits of Penner&#39;s appeal, circumstances leading to Penner&#39;s arrest &#34;raised mental health concerns.&#34;

A jury heard closing arguments in the case Tuesday. (Philippe Morin/CBC)A jury in Whitehorse heard closing arguments in the trial of Edward James Penner Tuesday.Penner is charged with first-degree murder in the 2017 shooting death of Adam Cormack, 25, at a gravel pit outside Whitehorse. Penner was 20 at the time.The Crown spent more than two weeks laying out its case. Prosecutor Tom Lemon summarized that case Tuesday, urging jurors that the evidence &#34;points in only one direction&#34; — that Penner planned to kill Cormack &#34;execution style&#34; and shot Cormack in the head with an AR-15 rifle.Lemon said Penner sent a Facebook message to friends in B.C. with photos of that gun, as well as loaded magazines.&#34;It&#39;s a stretch to believe that Mr. Penner equipped himself with an AR-15 just to send photos from Whitehorse,&#34; Lemon said. &#34;You don&#39;t have loaded magazines just to take pictures of them.&#34;Lemon said Penner and Cormack were both involved in the drug trade, and that Penner came to Whitehorse to investigate a missing handgun. When Penner was told Cormack had sold it, &#34;clearly the formulation of a plan to kill Adam Cormack was taking place,&#34; Lemon said.No blood or DNA on bulletThe Crown acknowledged that it can&#39;t prove that a bullet found at the scene killed Cormack. Investigators found no blood or DNA on it. But Lemon said the bullet can be fired from an AR-15 as well as other guns. And he said it closely resembles bullets seen in photos of the magazines Penner shared in Facebook messages.The defence didn&#39;t call any witnesses or bring any evidence during trial. But defence lawyer Andre Oullette argued the Crown&#39;s case is made up of &#34;theories, lies, suggestions and rumours&#34; and isn&#39;t strong enough to convict Penner.Oullette said the bullet could have been fired from a handgun, as well as a rifle. And he said the gravel pit is littered with old bullets and shell casings because it&#39;s used as a shooting range by Whitehorse residents.Oullette also said testimony from several Crown witnesses was unreliable because of drug use. He said witnesses who knew Cormack were trying to piece together their own narrative of what happened and that it&#39;s easy to pin the blame on an outsider like Penner. &#34;You&#39;re being invited to bypass reason,&#34; Oullette said. &#34;All of the evidence here is equivocal and ambiguous.&#34;Justice Scott Brooker will give his final instructions to the jury on Wednesday.CBC&#39;s Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Trial begins for B.C. man charged in Whitehorse murder B.C. man charged with 1st-degree murder in recent Whitehorse homicide RCMP investigating homicide in Whitehorse areaFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

A Quesnel man is appealing his first-degree murder conviction for a 2017 shooting in Yukon.
A Yukon Supreme Court jury found 22-year-old Quesnel resident Edward Penner guilty of an attack on Adam Cormack.
The 25-year-old Whitehorse man was shot to death in a gravel pit near that city in what the jury was told was a dispute over a gun.

Penner was convicted following a trial that ended in September and sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 25 years.
Earlier this month, papers arguing grounds for the conviction were unreasonable were filed to the Yukon Court of Appeal.
A date for the appeal has not been set. (CKRW)

The 2018 Toronto shooting, known locally as the Danforth shooting, was a mass shooting that occurred on Danforth Avenue in the Greektown neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada on the night of July 22, 2018.[4] Faisal Hussain killed two people and wounded thirteen using a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P .40-calibre handgun.[2][3] He died by suicide after a shootout with Toronto Police Service (TPS) officers.[5] While police were unwilling to give a motive for the shooting after a yearlong investigation, it is clear from the aftermath that the shooting was inspired and rooted in incel-related violence.[6]
Incident[edit]
Around 10:00 p.m. EDT on July 22, 2018, Faisal Hussain walked along Toronto&#39;s busy Danforth Avenue in the Greektown area of the city, randomly shooting pedestrians before opening fire on crowded restaurants.[7][8][9] The incident began around Danforth and Logan avenues near the restaurant named Christina&#39;s. Witnesses described 10 to 15 blasts similar to firecrackers, while others reported hearing gunshots and seeing a man holding a gun.[10] Further along the Danforth at Chester Avenue, witnesses said they saw a man shooting from a sidewalk into another restaurant named Demetre&#39;s. The shooter continued to walk westbound on Danforth Avenue towards Hampton Avenue, where witnesses said the shooter crossed the street from the north side to the south side and fired into the 7Numbers restaurant near Bowden Street where one victim was shot.[11] The shooter chose not to shoot certain people he encountered, telling one man, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not going to shoot you.&#34;[12] TPS officers responded to calls from witnesses and located the gunman on Bowden Street and initiated a shootout with the suspect. The gunman ran back to Danforth Avenue where he was found dead.[11]
At the corner of Danforth and Logan avenues, police cordoned off an area from bystanders and detonated an unidentified package for undisclosed reasons.[9]
Victims[edit]
People of Toronto left floral tributes for 18-year-old Reese Fallon with the message &#34;We are #Danforth&#34;
18-year-old Reese Fallon and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis were killed in the attack.[9][11][13]
Thirteen others suffered gunshot wounds, ranging in age from 17 to 59. Toronto Paramedic Services transported eight victims to trauma centres – including four people to St. Michael&#39;s Hospital, three to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and one to The Hospital for Sick Children.[11] St. Michael&#39;s reported it was treating five patients. Three of them underwent immediate lifesaving surgery after the shooting and the others were in serious but stable condition.[11][14]
Two gunshot victims were treated at the nearby Michael Garron Hospital and were in stable condition. Five other patients were treated for issues related to the shooting, but were not shot.[15]
Perpetrator[edit]
The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) identified the perpetrator as 29-year-old Faisal Hussain.[3]
Hussain was born to parents of Pakistani origin according to people who knew the family.[16][17] In a public statement, Hussain&#39;s parents said that he was psychotic and depressed throughout his life.[3][18] In 2010, Hussain told a friend that he was seeing a psychiatrist about these problems.[19] A former teacher described him as &#34;very disturbed&#34; and recounted having to take him to a psychiatric facility after he started carving into his face with the blade of a pencil sharpener.[20] Another former teacher called the police after Hussain allegedly said, without prompting, that &#34;I want to kill someone.&#34;[21] His family had been struggling through the death of his sister in a car accident and his brother&#39;s ongoing coma after an overdose or a stroke.[22][16] According to a neighbour, Hussain was not religious and declined to participate in Friday prayers.[23] According to his brother, Hussain had &#34;started attending a mosque with his father, but did not seem that interested in religion.&#34;[24]
In 2010, Hussain was investigated by TPS under the provincial Mental Health Act.[25] On July 24, 2018, the Ministry of Public Safety said there is currently no connection between him and national security.[26] He was not on any federal watchlists.[25] Some news reports suggested Hussain was inspired by Elliot Rodger and the incel ideology.[27]
Investigation[edit]
In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police did not identify a motive, saying that they were investigating &#34;every possible motive, including terrorism.&#34;[28] In June 2019, authorities finished a year long investigation and could not determine a motive for the attack.[29] Regarding the motive, Toronto police chief Mark Saunders said &#34;we may never know why&#34;.[29]
On July 23, police executed a search warrant at Hussain&#39;s residence in the Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood of the city.[24] A day later, CBS News published that, according to a law enforcement source, Hussain visited ISIL websites which may have expressed his support for the Islamic militant group; he was also speculated to have previously lived in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but the investigation has revealed that his actions did not appear to be directed by ISIL.[30] On July 25, Amaq News Agency, citing a &#34;security source&#34;, stated that he was &#34;from the soldiers of Islamic State&#34;,[31] yet Toronto Police said there was no evidence of an ISIL connection.[32] Amarnath Amarasingam of the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue doubted Amaq&#39;s claim and said it may have been prompted by the CBS News article.[33]

Since Hussain was found dead after a shootout, the SIU looked into whether he was shot by police or shot himself.[11] On July 23, it removed a police cruiser from the scene and said the two officers in it were being investigated for their roles in the shootout.[1][11] Hussain&#39;s handgun was also seized. On July 25, a police source told CBC News that Hussain died by suicide.[5] The same day, a police source told CP24 that the gun was from the United States and had been obtained from a &#34;gang-related source&#34;.[34][35] A police source later told CTV News it had been stolen in 2015 during a Saskatoon burglary.[36] It may have come to Hussain from his brother who lived at a house in Toronto&#39;s eastern suburb of Pickering where 33 guns were seized in 2017.[37]
Aftermath[edit]
Residents and business owners in the area started a crowdfunding campaign for funeral expenses of victims who died.[38] Meanwhile, the Canadian Blood Services said that they were closely monitoring response efforts and were encouraging donations in the aftermath of the shooting.[38]
The Toronto International Film Festival cancelled an event to promote its planned film slate out of respect for those affected by the shooting.[14]
Reactions[edit]
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale tweeted their condemnation of the shooting and praise of the police.[39] Ontario premier Doug Ford described the attack as &#34;the most brazen shooting&#34; of a year full of gun violence.[40] Toronto Mayor John Tory called the shooting an &#34;unspeakable act&#34; and an attack on a city with a gun problem. He said he planned to discuss public safety and the legality of guns with provincial and federal officials.[11]
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Greece expressed solidarity and condolence with the city&#39;s Greektown.[41] Calvary Church, located near the site of the shooting, held a prayer vigil, joined by a congregation from the nearby Madinah Mosque.[42]
The family of Faisal Hussain released a statement expressing &#34;our deepest condolences to the families who are now suffering on account of our son&#39;s horrific actions&#34;.[43][44]
Several sports teams and athletes showed their support on social media with the #TorontoStrong hashtag, which was also used after the van attack in North York City Centre in April 2018.[45]
