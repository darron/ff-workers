McKenzie murders
In the 1840s, large numbers of peasant farmers fled Famine Ireland for British North America. Many joined the sizeable Protestant and Catholic Irish communities in the area of Saint John, New Brunswick. One member of that community was Patrick Slavin, a man in his 50s or 60s who had worked constructing the European and North American railway and who in 1857 worked as a labourer.
His associate was a younger man, Hugh Breen, born in Oromocto, another labourer. Slavin lived in a cabin several miles from Saint John, in Simonds parish, with his wife and children, one of whom was teenaged Patrick Jr. In the weeks prior to the crime, Breen had boarded with the Slavins.
Persons of Irish birth and ethnicity were an important presence in Saint John and the surrounding county. Although they drew more attention, Potato Famine migrants of the 1840s, according to the 1851 census, were outnumbered by earlier immigrants. In 1871 more than half of the population of the city of 23,315 were ethnically Irish. The neighbouring communities of Portland and Simonds also included many immigrant and second-generation Irish, many of them Protestant. Simonds parish was a largely rural community that lay between Saint John and the coastal community of St. Martin&#39;s.
Another resident of the area was Robert McKenzie, a Scottish immigrant and businessman who was reputed to have a sizeable personal fortune. In 1857 he lived with his young family at his farm near Beaver Lake, in the Mispec area, and operated a chair factory. On a Sunday morning in October, a local man discovered nothing left of McKenzie&#39;s farm on the Black River Road but smouldering ruins; a search of the burned buildings revealed the bodies of husband, wife and one child.
The investigation
A local magistrate directed search of the ruins. Two adults and four children were unaccounted for, but only the partial remains of the two parents and one child were found. The discovery of the bodies and of an open but empty safe, and the fact that both the main house and the farm labourer’s house had burned, created suspicion in the minds of local magistrates and the Saint John police. McKenzie, who in addition to owning a business and a large farm was a money lender, was rumoured to be fairly wealthy.
All these circumstances led to the conclusion that there had been violence done, and suspicion immediately fell on a man who had been in the neighbourhood and about McKenzie&#39;s some days previous but who had subsequently disappeared. This man who gave his name while at McKenzie&#39;s as WILLIAMS, but who was elsewhere known as BREEN or GREEN or McGUIRE had engaged with McKenzie to come and hire with him, his former hired man having just left to go to Canada and had left McKenzie&#39;s on the day previous, Friday; saying that he would be back Saturday night with his wife and furniture. He appears, however, to have gone instead to the house of a man named SLAVIN, three or four miles distant on another road, where he had been residing of and on for the previous four or five weeks and where, there is no doubt, from what has since transpired, that the crime was planned.
At the Coroner&#39;s inquest, the most important evidence came from the John Slavin, the young son of Patrick, who testified that on the night of the murders, robbery and arson, his father, older brother Pat and Hugh Breen had disappeared then returned with clothing, money and other property, and acted suspiciously. Testimony from other witnesses corroborated this information.
Mrs. Slavin had attempted to shift the suspicion of the inquest jury to Breen. The Saint John police eventually tracked down the three suspects hiding in the woods ten miles from Slavin&#39;s home in Simonds parish. They had been aided and abetted by another Irish family, which was related to the Slavins through marriage. The police eventually found close to eighty sovereigns in cash. The Coroner&#39;s jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against the suspects.
Trial of Patrick Slavin Jr.
The McKenzie murders were unprecedented for their brutality; an entire family, including an infant only one year old, had been killed by an axe. The Grand Jury found true bills against the three prisoners for the murder of McKenzie and his wife and children. Breen and the elder Slavin entered guilty pleas; only young Patrick, who appeared to have been an accessory to murder, was placed on trial.
Pat&#39;s major role appeared to have been keeping watch, but testimony indicated that he may have entered the farmhouse after the killings to search for loot. He was assigned, by the trial judge, an able barrister, Davis S. Kerr, who objected to reports that he had been actually hired by the defendants. He was assisted by A.R. Wetmore. The elder Slavin was formally charged with the murder of Mrs. Effie McKenzie and of an unnamed child of Robert and Effie McKenzie. He pleaded guilty to both counts.
Although the law held teenagers to be legally responsible, in practice juries were loathe to subject them to the full wrath of the criminal sanction. The prosecution was conducted by Solicitor General Charles Fisher, who explained that Pat&#39;s statement was the most important evidence, assisted by Attorney General Charles Watters. Under English criminal law, young Slavin, although he had not taken part in the violence, was as guilty as his father. A neighbour who had employed Pat Slavin testified that he was &#39;not a bad boy&#39; although he lacked common sense.
Several witnesses described him as &#39;simple.&#39; The Slavin family, who lived in a log hut in upper Loch Lomond, was described as poor. Pat, who had been born in Ireland, had arrived in New Brunswick in the late 1840s. Young John Slavin repeated his damning evidence against his father and Breen, which suggested how they had planned the crime in advance. According to Saint John&#39;s chief of police, son Pat had blamed Breen for both planning the crime and carrying out the murders.
Hugh Breen&#39;s testimony
Despite Pat&#39;s attempt to place the blame on him, Breen, who had already pleaded guilty, did not implicate him in the violence. According to Breen, the youth helped to loot the house, helped to burn the two dwellings and carried loot home:
I went to the house and asked McKenzie to come down as my wife had come. Old Slavin said not to make a fire, and after it was made we put it out. McKenzie came down with a candle in his hand and old Slavin took the axe used for chopping wood out of my hand. His son was there. There were two or three in the house. Slavin was in one place and McKenzie in another.
When McKenzie came in, Slavin came out and said &#34;she is on hand&#34; (this was referring to my wife&#39;s coming). He had the axe in his hand and hit McKenzie on the breast, he said &#34;dead dogs tell no lies.&#34; He hit him on the breast with the back of the axe, McKenzie groaned but did not speak. We put him into the cellar and old Slavin afterwards brought him up.  When we went to the upper house Slavin asked me if I knew the house; he told me to go in and watch the door till he got a view of her. He then went in and Mrs. McKenzie was sitting at the fire with a child in her arms. She asked if she was coming (meaning my wife) Slavin then struck her with the axe on her head and she fell over the edge of the stone; he then struck her three blows on the body. He then struck the children who were standing round their mother crying, he killed the whole of them; the children cried, but Mrs. McKenzie did not. Prisoner and me took no direct part in the murder; we were standing in the porch at the time.
Testimony of Patrick Slavin Sr.
We went up to the house, Breen and I, I was first, Breen showed me the way. I did not take the axe. There was one at the door, Breen gave it to me. When I went in I saw Mrs. McKenzie sitting by the fire and the four children beside her. I struck her on the head 10 or 15 times. I killed them all. They did not cry much. We searched the house and found over 100 pounds of money. It was myself that ransacked the chest, the money was in gold. It was in a yellow bag, like the one in Court. There was a purse also and portmanteau. The boy was knocking about keeping watch. We had something to eat. We though it best to set fire to the houses. Breen and I both did it.
Defence counsel used the word &#34;extraordinary&#34; to described the situation where one self-confessed murderer was testifying for the Crown and another for the defence.
The defence planned to use testimony by &#34;old&#34; Slavin, despite his plea of guilty, to shift the blame on Breen, and to protect the boy. Pat was described as a simple boy, much in fear of his father, and unable to distinguish between right and wrong. Kerr and Wetmore argued that Pat had no prior knowledge of the murder plot, but was possibly guilty of conspiring to commit robbery.
On the question of his son&#39;s involvement, Slavin testified:
I have three boys Pat Slavin, 15 to 16, Johnnie Slavin, 10 to 11, and Jamie Slavin, 6 to 7, Pat knows right from wrong; I have sometimes been too severe to him. He did not know when we left what we were going to do; if he had refused to go, I would have made him. He is a tender hearted boy and has not looked the same since. It was I that killed them all. I am aware that the sentence of death will be passed on me. I have told the truth...
Verdict and sentencing
The Crown&#39;s summation stressed factual evidence, the statements of the accused and circumstantial evidence. Patrick Slavin Jr. was described as a boy of &#34;a most diabolical nature, and was not fit to let loose on this country.&#34; The prosecution disputed suggestions, supposedly fuelled by sentimentality, that the youth was insane or mentally incapable. The Attorney General commented that prior to this case he had opposed capital punishment. Judge Parker, in his charge to the jury, was overcome by emotion.
He dismissed the coercion defense offered by Kerr, and stated that the jury would have to decide whether or not the youth had the ability to distinguish right from wrong.
Judge Parker passed sentence on the two adults, who were scheduled to be hanged on December 11, 1857. Slavin stated that he was satisfied. The prisoners were reported as exhibited a &#34;firm demeanour&#34; throughout the entire proceedings.
The jury returned a verdict of guilty against Patrick Jr., with a recommendation for mercy. Sentencing was deferred. Judge Robert Parker&#39;s sentence contained a detailed justification, as if to underscore the sensitive nature of the case. He announced that he would recommend to the executive level of government a sentence of imprisonment to the provincial penitentiary. But in the meantime, he was sentenced to be hanged on March 4.
Deaths of Breen and Slavin Sr.
As Saint John prepared for a public double hanging, the case took an unexpected twist:
BREEN one of the McKENZIE murderers committed Suicide Sunday eve. last by hanging himself. He was found suspended by an old yellow silk handkerchief from a small piece of wood, one end of which rested on a shelf and the other on a cleet. A bit of wood, which had a hole bored in it and fitting on the stump of an old nail, assisted in the support of the cross stick. The place was too low for the purpose, unless he pressed the weight of his body on his throat by raising his feet. The only persons allowed to visit him alone were Mrs. DOHERTY, Mrs. CARVELL, Mrs. TRAVERS and Miss HAGERTY, the Sisters of Charity and the Priest. Mrs. Doherty was with him from half past six. About 20 minutes after she left, Miss CREIGHTON went to the wicket and called Breen but got no answer. The Priest stated in his evidence before the Coroner that he was visiting him a few minutes before 7 o&#39;clock. He had been called out in a hurry and on going to Breen&#39;s cell door, he saw him as if kneeling. He went towards him and finding he had hung himself, assisted some persons to take him down. We understand he was buried last night in the Almshouse Burying Ground.
The Carleton Sentinel was one of many newspapers to report Slavin&#39;s execution, which was stage outside the county jail, in full view of a large crowd. A detachment of soldiers from the British garrison, armed with rifles and bayonets, was on hand to keep order.
Yesterday being the day appointed for the execution, and the prisoner Patrick SLAVIN Senior still to dispose of, crowds began at an early hour to assemble in front of the Jail ... About ten o&#39;clock, the hour previously given notice of for the execution to take place, the crowd in front of the Jail could not have been less than 5 or 6 thousand. About ten minutes past ten, the prisoner stepped on the platform accompanied by Charles JOHNSTON, Esq., High Sheriff and Rev. SWEENY, Catholic Priest. There were also in attendance his Worship the Mayor, George BLATCH, Esq., Acting Deputy Sheriff, the Jailor THOMAS and a number of Magistrates of the City and County. The Sheriff himself performed the duty of adjusting the fatal noose and Constable PIDGEON having drawn the cap over the prisoner&#39;s face, he stepped forward on the drop and seemed for a minute either listening to, or accompanying Rev. Sweeny in prayer, during which time the Sheriff, having stepped inside, cut the support, the drop fell and death seemed to be almost instantaneous.
Postscript
As many predicted, the sentence of young Patrick Slavin was commuted to life in prison. Years later he managed to escape from the penitentiary on Courtenay Bay and fled across the border to Maine.
Slavin&#39;s mother, who had taken charge of some of the murderers&#39; ill-gotten gains, and who had assisted in hiding the fugitives, drew the attention of the press several weeks following the execution of her husband when she remarried. The groom was a man who had been charged with rape but acquitted in 1857.
Saint John County Courthouse, 2006
The old jail, which was demolished in the 1970&#39;s, was in the rear of the building. Patrick Slavin was hanged from a gallows platform built outside the jail.

The Cypress Hills Massacre[1][2][3] occurred on June 1, 1873, near Battle Creek in the Cypress Hills region of Canada&#39;s North-West Territories (now in Saskatchewan). It involved a group of American bison hunters, American wolf hunters or &#34;wolfers&#34;, American and Canadian whisky traders, Métis cargo haulers or &#34;freighters&#34;, and a camp of Assiniboine people. Thirteen or more Assiniboine warriors and one wolfer died in the conflict. The Cypress Hills Massacre prompted the Canadian government to accelerate the recruitment and deployment of the newly formed North-West Mounted Police.
Incident[edit]
The incident began in the spring of 1873 when a small party of Canadian Red River Métis and American wolfers, led by Thomas W. Hardwick and John Evans, was returning from their winter hunt. While they were camped on the Teton River, their horses disappeared overnight. Presuming that their horses had been stolen by &#39;Indians&#39;, the men travelled on foot to Fort Benton, Montana Territory, about five miles, and asked for assistance from the local authorities to retrieve them. The authorities at Fort Benton refused to assist them, however,[4] so Hardwick organised his own expedition and set off to retrieve the stolen horses. The party numbered 13 men, comprising both U.S. and Canadian &#39;free traders&#39; and wolf-hunters.[4]
The group quickly travelled from Fort Benton northward across the border in pursuit of the stolen horses. They eventually arrived at Abe Farwell&#39;s small trading post located in the Cypress Hills region. While there, they encountered George Hammond, a friend of both Evans and Hardwick, who had been selling whisky in the area. Hammond subsequently joined Hardwick&#39;s group in the search for the missing horses.[5]
Farwell had assured Evans that Little Soldier, the leader of a small band of Assiniboine camped near the trading post, had no horses with them. After a brief search it was determined by the group that Little Soldier showed no evidence that he had stolen their horses, so Evans, Hammond, and the rest of the wolfers retired for the night to Farwell&#39;s trading post, where they spent the evening and the next morning drinking Farwell&#39;s whisky with a group of recently arrived Métis freighters.
In the morning Hammond complained that one of Little Soldier&#39;s men had stolen his horse for a second time,[6] and started towards Little Soldier&#39;s camp, insisting that the rest of the wolfers join him to retrieve his horse. The wolfers, along with the Métis, followed Hammond to the Assiniboine camp.
Historical accounts differ on what happened during the skirmish, as there were no reliable testimonies. The best information states that:
Abe Farwell testified that he tried to restrain Hammond in an attempt to avoid any violence.[6]
Hammond approached Little Soldier&#39;s tent asking about the missing horse.
Little Soldier replied that his group had not stolen the horse but that it was grazing on a nearby hill.
Both Little Soldier&#39;s and Hammond&#39;s parties were intoxicated, and negotiations between them fell through. Little Soldier offered Hammond two of his horses as hostages until the missing horse could be found, but the situation became increasingly tense as women and children began fleeing from the camp and Little Soldier&#39;s men began stripping off their garments in preparation for battle.[7]: 135
The wolfers regarded these actions as a signal for a fight and lined up along a riverbank fifty yards outside the Assiniboine camp. In a last-ditch effort to avoid violence, Abe Farwell pleaded with the wolfers, asking them not to start shooting. Before he could continue negotiating with Little Soldier and the wolfers, Farwell saw Hammond fire his rifle. The rest of the wolfers, protected by the tall river bank, then fired volleys into the camp. The Assiniboine, using inferior weapons, returned fire, but were unable to sustain an attack due to the wolfers&#39; protected position.[6]
The total number of casualties reported differs widely in various accounts. One of Hardwick&#39;s men—Ed Legrace—was killed, but the number of Assiniboine casualties was higher. In the personal account of Donald Graham, who joined the wolfers at Fort Benton and travelled with them to the Cypress Hills, he states that 13 of Little Soldier&#39;s men were killed in the exchanges of fire. After the battle, the wolfers buried Legrace in a cabin and set the building ablaze. Some sources claim that Legrace&#39;s wooden coffin still remains there to this day.[8]
The site of the massacre was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1964.[2] Artifacts from the Cypress Hills Massacre have also been preserved at nearby Fort Walsh National Historic Site, along with reconstructions of Farwell&#39;s and Solomon&#39;s trading posts.
Aftermath[edit]
North-West Mounted Police, 1900
News of the Cypress Hills Massacre did not reach Ottawa until late August 1873, therefore the event itself was not very well known in Canada. The Canadian government soon took steps to have those involved extradited from the United States and tried for murder, causing confrontation between Canada and the United States. The case languished for some time and then was taken up by the newly created North-West Mounted Police (NWMP). The NWMP at this time was still establishing itself; the battle between the Assiniboine warriors and Hardwick&#39;s group of wolf-hunters at Cypress Hills was one of the catalysts for its creation.
Investigation and trials[edit]
In December 1874, Assistant Commissioner James Macleod was given permission by the U.S. government to enter Helena, Montana Territory to start an investigation into the Cypress Hills Massacre. Depending upon the findings of this investigation, the accused could have faced extradition to Canada to face trial under Canadian law. Seven arrests were made, but two men escaped custody before they could be examined. The remaining men were freed because there was not enough clear evidence to prove anything against them, and the American commissioner refused the extradition request as there was far too much conflicting testimony. The Canadian Commissioner (Macleod) was subsequently charged with false arrest, but this charge was soon dropped.
In June, 1876, shortly after they were released from custody in the United States, two traders and a wolfer crossed the border into Canada and were subsequently arrested and put on trial in Winnipeg. The Crown&#39;s case against them failed, however, once again weakened by insufficient or contradictory evidence. The three men were acquitted, and the case was finally dropped in 1882.[9]
W. E. Cullen, the American commissioner, said at the extradition hearing at Helena: although the &#34;preponderance of testimony is to the effect that the Indians commenced the firing... they were doubtlessly provoked to this by the apparently hostile attitudes of the whites... An armed party menacing their camp, no matter for what purpose, was by no means slight provocations.&#34;[9]
Creation of the North-West Mounted Police[edit]
It is very difficult to measure the impact that the Cypress Hills Massacre had on Canada and the United States. The creation of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP, later the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), was introduced partially as a result of the massacre. Around this time, the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, Alexander Morris, was concerned about perceived threats of violence to uniformed Canadians and Americans conducting geological surveys. As a result, Morris had to call off any further surveying until there was a solution. Unable to find a solution, Morris used the reports of the massacre to call on the Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald, to create a police force. Already planning to establish a police force in the North-West Territories, Macdonald had envisioned a horse mounted brigade based on the idea of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The force would be small; only 300 men could enlist. For an area that covered 480,000 square kilometres,[9] the force would have to be as mobile as possible. Alexander Campbell, the minister of the interior, did not believe sending an armed police force into the North-West Territories was necessary at this time, causing Morris to fear that any delay in training and deployment could be exacerbated further once winter fell. To force their creation, Morris claimed that the Métis and white settlers in the area around Portage la Prairie and Fort Qu&#39;Appelle were experiencing fear and unrest due to the massacre.[9] On September 25, 1873, the government of Canada passed an order-in-council to appoint nine officers of &#34;Mounted Police Force for the North-West Territories&#34;. Recruitment began immediately, and the North-West Mounted Police was created. With the new police force patrolling the area, the border could no longer be so easily crossed.[9]
The creation of the police force also had a political motive. The investigation into the massacre was to ensure that First Nations in the area were able to trust the Canadian government. The investigation would require international cooperation of two federal governments, and the North-West Mounted Police would take measures to make examples out of international criminals. Although ultimately no prosecution took place, the willingness to seek justice for any Canadian contributed to the establishment of peace between the NWMP and First Nations.[9]
As time went on the Cypress Hills Massacre gradually became part of popular knowledge about Canada&#39;s past even though the event was never fully closed and dealt with.
In media[edit]
Sheridan in the 1860s
When the news of the Cypress Hills Massacre broke into eastern Canada, it introduced a wave of anti-Americanism. In the news, the American men were described as &#34;American gangsters&#34; and &#34;American scums&#34;. The idea that only American frontiersmen could commit this outrage had been maintained in many Canadian written accounts of the massacre. Canadians were not only shocked that the Americans committed such a crime in their country, but now the media was putting an increased negative view on Americans. Canadians believed that Americans would continually murder people on Canadian soil.[10] This fear was summed up by General Philip Sheridan&#39;s infamous statement to Tosawi of the Comanche, &#34;The only good Indians I ever saw were dead.&#34;[10]
Although Canadians also took part in the Cypress Hills Massacre, it remains overlooked in western Canadian history. Even though it took place in Canada, the massacre represented a temporary extension of American frontier mentality into the Canadian northwest.
In fiction[edit]
A fictionalized account of the events of the Cypress Hills Massacre is told in the novel The Englishman&#39;s Boy by Canadian author Guy Vanderhaeghe.[11] The story focuses in part on the character of the &#34;Englishman&#39;s boy&#34;, one of the members of the party of wolfers. While little is known of those involved in the actual event, the novel attributes the cause of the massacre to one Tom Hardwick, the &#34;lead&#34; wolfer. The book was made into a miniseries that first appeared on CBC Television in March 2008.
The movie The Canadians was another fictionalized version. The Cypress Hills Massacre is also used as the plot centrepiece for the Terrance Dicks novel Massacre In the Hills which charts the beginning of the NWMP.

Alexander &#39;Sandy&#39; Keith, Jr.
(1827�1875) was a notorious nineteenth century criminal from Halifax,
Nova Scotia.
Keith was born in 1827 in Caithness, Scotland,
immigrating to Halifax when he was a small boy. The nephew of Alexander
Keith, founder of the Alexander Keith&#39;s brewery, Keith worked for a time
as a clerk in his uncle&#39;s brewery.
Keith became a secret agent for the Confederate
States of America during the American Civil War, acting mostly as a
blockade runner and courier. He was involved with Luke Blackburn in an
infamous plot to send clothes infected with yellow fever to northern
cities in the United States.
In 1865, he swindled his associates-in-crime and fled
to St. Louis, Missouri, settling finally on the prairie. There, he
married Cecelia Paris, a milliner&#39;s daughter from St. Louis.
Hunted down by one of his victims, he fled again with
Cecelia to Germany, where they lived the high life in Dresden and
Leipzig, hobnobbing with wealthy socialites and Saxon generals under the
assumed name of William King Thomas. When the couple began to run
out of money, Keith concocted a plot to blow up passenger ships and
collect the insurance money.
This led to a major catastrophe in Bremerhaven, in
December 1875 when one of his bombs accidentally went off on a dock,
killing eighty people. At the time, the deed was known as the &#34;crime of
the century. Keith was aboard another ship at the time and was aware of
the premature detenation of his time bomb, and the massive carnage. He
went to his suite in the ship he was on and shot himself. He died in a
week&#39;s time.&#34;
After the tragedy was revealled as a murder/insurance
scam on a large scale, the disappearance of other ships were looked into
to see if Keith and his possible associates were involved. One was the
disappearance of the SS City of Boston which vanished in January 1870.

The Dynamite Fiend
By Ann Larabee - St Louis Magazine
In the final months of the Civil War, a gentleman
took rooms in St. Louis� Southern Hotel. He was a bear of a man with a
huge appetite and memorably bad table manners. Flashing wads of cash, he
impressed the staff with tales of his speculations on Wall Street. He
intimated that he and the hotel steward, known as the Frenchman, had
been daring blockade runners together in the Bahamas. Most St. Louisans
who met Alexander King Thompson were completely taken in by his
amiability, generosity and dash.
But Thompson was not what he seemed. Ten years later,
his friends in the Southern Hotel would learn that they had laughed and
joked with the most devious mass murderer of the 19th century. The
amiable Alexander King Thompson hid an evil Mr. Hyde: Alexander �Sandy�
Keith Jr., a Confederate agent from Halifax, Nova Scotia, whose greed
would lead him to kill 81 people in a single blow and earn him the
nickname the �Dynamite Fiend.�
Sandy Keith began his ruthless career early. Born in
the Scottish Highlands in 1827, he immigrated to Canada when he was a
boy. He went to work in the brewery of his uncle, Alexander Keith, a
respected businessman and three-time mayor of Halifax. Envious of his
uncle�s wealth and power, the younger Keith began forging his uncle�s
name on phony bills of exchange and was probably responsible for blowing
up the Halifax powder magazine in 1857 to cover up a gunpowder swindle.
At the start of the Civil War, Southern blockade
runners began arriving in Halifax, eager for
adventure and profit. Keith saw his chance and became their
purchasing agent. He was so popular among the blockade runners that he
became known as the �Confederate Consul,� offering his wealthy new
friends the finest champagne in his rooms at the Halifax Hotel.
But even more devious operations were afoot in Halifax. As the war
became ever more desperate for the Confederacy, Southerners hiding in
Canada plotted raids and terrorist attacks across the border. Keith was
in the thick of it, and, because he had earned their trust, the
conspirators enlisted him in their schemes.
The most ruthless of these, at least in spirit, was organized by Dr.
Luke Blackburn, who would later become governor of Kentucky. The good
doctor volunteered his services to yellow-fever patients in Bermuda,
collected their soiled clothes and linens and had the goods sent through
Halifax to Northern cities for auction. Keith was involved in the
shipment of this 19th century version of bioterrorism. Luckily, it
failed; Blackburn was of the mistaken belief that yellow fever is
transmitted through human contact, but mosquitoes are the real carriers.
By the end of 1864, Confederate operatives and blockade runners were
eager to squeeze as much profit as they could from the war before their
inevitable defeat, and they heaped money in Keith�s hands. He feigned
enthusiasm for their cause while secretly plotting to destroy them.
Inspired by Confederate bomb makers such as Thomas Courtenay, a St.
Louis insurance salesman who invented a device with which to blow up
Union steamships, Keith began to form an idea: He would use time bombs
to blow up ships and collect the insurance money.
Some later believed that Keith had used a bomb to scuttle a ship
carrying the theatrical costumes of John Wilkes Booth, who performed in
Montreal in 1864.
To the surprise of his Confederate chums, Keith vanished in December
1864, taking with him $1 million worth of investments and Mary Clifton,
a chambermaid from the Halifax Hotel. For a brief time, he hid in Boston
and New York, enjoying a lavish lifestyle funded by his ill-gotten gains.
But when a private detective, hired by his angry victims, came close to
catching him, Keith abandoned Clifton and fled to the farthest point on
the rail: St. Louis.
Deeply divided in its loyalties and with its own history of devious
Confederate operations, the city was a harbor for Sandy Keith. Here, the
infamous boat-burners sneaked around the docks, setting fire to Union
ships and placing infernal machines in their coal bunkers. Some 60 ships,
carrying soldiers and innocent civilians, had met their fates in this
way.
Keith undoubtedly felt he had reached a haven in the Southern Hotel,
a cheerful yellow-limestone building between Fourth and Fifth streets.
Theodore Dreiser, who later worked as a news reporter in St. Louis,
wrote that the Southern was �my favorite cure for all despondent gray
days�where all was warm, brisk, colorful, gay, in fact. Here was no
least sign of poverty or want, but only of comfort or luxury.�
But the tentacles of the angry Confederate network were longer than
Keith had ever imagined, and he was tracked down again by the detective.
Keith offered the man a $5,000 bribe, packed his valise with his
remaining cash and ran again, this time 30 miles east to Highland, Ill.,
a small enclave of Swiss immigrants out on the Looking Glass Prairie.
Here he met a small, dark-eyed young woman, Cecelia, the illegitimate
daughter of an imperious St. Louis milliner, Madame Louise Paris. They
married a few months later.
The couple settled down to a happy life, often visiting the bride�s
family in St. Louis. Early one morning in December 1865, sleeping off
the effects of a Christmas party, they were surprised to hear a loud rap
on the door of their room in the Highland boarding house. Keith opened
the door to find a U.S. marshal, a St. Louis detective and one of
Keith�s victims, Luther Rice Smoot, quartermaster of the state of
Virginia. Keith had stolen $25,000 from him. The men muscled Keith to St.
Louis and locked him in the city jail until he could come up with enough
money to satisfy Smoot.
It was a dreadful twist of fate, for if Smoot had never found him,
Keith might have lived a quiet, law-abiding life in Highland. Instead,
fearful that his other victims would hunt him down, he embarked on a
voyage that would lead to murder and mayhem unprecedented in the annals
of crime.
On a wintry day in January 1866, a panicky Keith and his wife made
for New York and boarded a transatlantic ship bound for Germany. For
several years, they lived the high life in Dresden with their stolen
wealth, hobnobbing with expatriate American socialites and Saxon
generals.
The couple burned through the money at a fantastic rate, champagne
flowing like water at their lavish parties, until Keith saw bankruptcy
looming. To prevent a humiliating downfall, he came up with a diabolical
plot inspired by his old days as a Confederate agent: He would have
worthless export goods insured for a huge sum and get them placed aboard
a ship carrying one of his expertly designed clockwork bombs. The ship
would disappear at sea, taking all of its passengers and the evidence of
his swindle with it, and he would collect the insurance money.
Crossing the Atlantic with his deadly time bomb, Keith made at least
two failed attempts to get the plan to work. Then he set his sights on
the steamship Mosel, docked in the German port of Bremerhaven.
On December 13, 1875, traveling under the name William King Thomas,
Keith took his bomb, packed in a barrel, to the harbor. Leaving the
barrel with the porters, he boarded the Mosel and took a first-class
cabin. Outside on the busy quay, the porters loaded the barrel into a
horse-drawn wagon and wheeled it toward the ship. They were attaching it
to a winch when it suddenly fell, hit the dock and exploded with
tremendous force.
Witnesses described the scene as a battlefield. The blast caved in
the bow of the Mosel and buckled the deck of the Simson, its tug. Cabins
and decks were covered with sand, broken glass and pieces of wood and
twisted iron. On the cobbled loading area of the dock, the explosion
produced a black, smoking hole 6 feet deep and 7 feet wide. Body parts
lay everywhere, and the air was filled with the moans of the wounded and
the dying. Keith had killed 81 people and seriously injured 50 more.
From his cabin on the Mosel, Keith heard the blast that signaled his
fatal mistake. He rushed onto the deck and looked down at the carnage he
had caused. He took deep swigs from his schnapps flask before descending
to his cabin.
He sat down and wrote a letter in heavy pencil to his wife: �God
bless you and my darling children, you will never see me to speak to
again.� He wrote another to the Mosel�s captain: �What I have seen today
I cannot stand.� Then he picked up his revolver and pumped two bullets
into his head.
But the world was not yet done with Keith. Rescuers discovered him
groaning in his cabin and took him to the baggage hall that had been
turned into a makeshift hospital. He lay among his victims as suspicious
police inspectors interrogated him and finally extracted a brief
confession.
Five days later, Cecelia was led to her husband in his final hours.
Seeing him in such a terrible state, she begged the doctors, �Kill him!
Kill him!� Then she threw herself at her husband�s side and urged him to
repent, but Keith gave her no satisfaction. Instead, his last words were
�I have been a thick head. The fellows in New York are guilty.�
After Keith�s death, a massive investigation ensued on both sides of
the Atlantic to find his real identity and to establish whether he had
had accomplices. The news spread rapidly in the international press,
striking panic in ocean travelers, who wondered whether they might be
the next victims of a new species of criminal.
In St. Louis, reading the sensational reports, the staff at the
Southern Hotel had an eerie feeling that they might have known the
Dynamite Fiend, described as a fat, bearded gentleman with a voracious
appetite who constantly bragged about his blockade-running days. Seeing
an opportunity for fame, one of the clerks sauntered down to the St.
Louis Republican and told reporters of the mysterious stranger who�d
come to town 10 years earlier. The newspaper ran the story, and the
famous detective Allan Pinkerton, who�d been hired by the Bremen police
to investigate, rushed to St. Louis to confirm it.
In Bremen, the coroner requested permission to preserve the Dynamite
Fiend�s head for scientific purposes. The rest of Keith�s body was
tossed into a pauper�s grave, but the head was placed in a jar and kept
in a Bremen museum. Local legend has it that during an Allied bombing of
the city, the jar burst, dumping the head into the general mayhem, where
it was mixed with newly dismembered body parts. Finally it came to rest
with the �unidentified.�
The flamboyant Sandy Keith, anonymous at last.

&#39;Dynamite
fiend&#39; had deep roots in famous family
The Dynamite Fiend:
The Chilling Story of Alexander Keith Jr.,
Nova Scotia Spy, Con-Artist &amp; International Terrorist
By Ann Larabee
LUCK and good instincts led
American historian Ann Larabee to uncover the story of one of the 19th-century&#39;s
notorious mass murderers.
The feared &#34;dynamite fiend&#34;
just happens to have deep roots in a famous Canadian family. Rooting
deep in the archives of Bremen, Germany, Larabee discovered the
forgotten 130-year-old story of Alexander Keith Jr., a heartless man who
could have inspired Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s classic horror story Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Most knew him as a jovial, prosperous businessman,
friend of the town&#39;s well-heeled burghers and a good family man who
loved buying presents for his children.
In reality, he was a swindler,
a spy linked to international terrorism in the American Civil War and a
pitiless murderer.
Larabee&#39;s narrative begins as
a simple story of a well-to-do Keith family in 19th-century Halifax. The
owners of Alexander Keith and Son Brewery were leading citizens and
powerful political voices in colonial Halifax.
Unfortunately, a nephew,
Alexander (Sandy) Keith, was the black sheep of the family. Sandy began
passing himself off as Alexander Keith Jr. and associating with
unscrupulous characters, including Confederate blockade runners who did
their business in Halifax&#39;s posh hotels.
Young Keith had one goal -- to
be as rich as Midas. He connived with the desperate Southern patriots
and swindled millions from them.
When they demanded their money
back, he escaped to New York and lost much of his money on the stock
market. He abandoned his pregnant wife when the city became too
dangerous for him but found a new one and more dupes to con in St.
Louis.
When his enemies closed in on
him, Keith fled to Germany and raised a family under the alias of
William Thomas. In the early 1870s, the money began to run out, and
Keith needed a new swindle to maintain his bourgeois faade.
Up to this point, Larabee&#39;s
story is a commonplace sleazy tale. Yes, Keith was a bad man, but now he
steps into the shoes of infamy. He was, argues Larabee, the first mass
murderer to simultaneously exploit the weakness of one technology and
the strength of another to serve his deadly purpose.
In the 1870s, steamship
technology was new and dangerous. A ship&#39;s boilers sometimes blew up
during the ocean crossing and the vessel was never seen again.
Keith surmised he could over-insure
some goods being shipped to the U.S. and collect when the ship sank. All
he had to do was make sure the ship went under.
To do this Keith took
advantage of another new technology: dynamite. Dynamite was invented in
the 1860s, and Keith believed he could construct a time-bomb in a wooden
barrel, place it on a ship and have it explode when the ship was at sea.
In 1875, Keith arranged to
have his barrel-bomb stowed on a ship set to sail from Bremerhaven,
Germany, to New York. He had been only able to insure it for a few
thousand dollars. Sinking this ship wouldn&#39;t make him rich; it was only
a test of his evil plan.
Catastrophe stuck when
dockworkers dropped the barrel and the ensuing massive explosion left,
&#34;135 orphans, 45 widows and 20 hopelessly maimed victims.&#34;
Keith was on the ship and in
apparent despair tried to commit suicide but lingered on for five days.
He refused to give police a reason for his actions and fears of a
terrorist conspiracy gripped Europe.
Psychologists and writers
speculated on the motives and character of the &#34;Dynamite Fiend.&#34; After
his death, Keith&#39;s head was cut off in the hope that phrenologists could
analyse the bumps on his head.
He never expressed any remorse
or made a confession to his wife. His last words to his doctors were
simply, writes Larabee, &#34;I have had ill luck; that&#39;s all.&#34;
The
Keith family of Halifax was able to disassociate itself from William
Thomas/Alexander Keith Jr. It squashed the story, and he was never heard
from again. That is until now. Thanks, Ann Larabee.

Swift
RUNNER










Classification: Mass murderer
Characteristics: Cannibalism
Number of victims: 6
Date of murder: 1879
Date of arrest:
May 27, 1879
Date of birth: ???
Victim profile:
His wife and five
children
Method of murder:
Shooting - Hitting with an axe
Location: Fort
Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada
Status:
Executed by hanging at Fort Saskatchewan on December 20, 1879





Swift Runner was a Cree Indian who lived
during the last century in what is now central Alberta. His background
seemed not unusual. As a young man he received a solid useful Cree
education; he married and had a family of six children; he traded with
the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company; and, in 1875, he served as a guide for the
North West Mounted Police.
But Swift Runner&#39;s life ended in tragedy and
notoriety. During the winter of 1878-79, a time of starvation and
misery for the Cree people, he became possessed by the Windigo
psychosis (an aberration characterized by grand delusions and
cannibalistic impulses that anthropologists have identified in several
Canadian Indian cultures). He murdered his wife and family and cooked
and ate their flesh. Eventually he was arrested, brought to trial, and
in December, 1879, hanged at Fort Saskatchewan.

I�ve always had a soft spot for westerns, and
during the late 1980s I went through a phase of writing western
stories�primarily for the magazines of the now-defunct Western
Publications in Stillwater, Oklahoma. While researching a major series
for True West called �Grandmother�s Land: Sitting Bull in
Canada,� I stumbled into this, ah, tasty little story
somewhere in the Mounted Police reports.
When the story ran in the quarterly Old West,
I accompanied it with an image from the collection of the Glenbow
Museum. It showed Swift Runner with a scowling Mountie in pillbox hat.
I�ve always found this photo of Swift Runner unsettling.
Approaching it in the nature of protagonist Alan
Grant in The Daughter of Time, by Josephine Tey�disregarding
the massive shackles, and the knowledge of his horrific crime, and
assuming innocence�I think I might have drawn an alarming conclusion.
He had a pleasant face, making me think that he was someone who loved
to laugh. I would likely have passed a pleasant moment chatting, had I
run into him on the street.
Windigo!
First published in OLD WEST, Summer 1990
During the winter, a Windigo ate Swift Runner�s
family. Swift Runner was a Cree hunter and trapper from the country
north of Fort Edmonton. He was a big man, over six feet tall, and well
liked. He was mild and trustworthy, a considerate husband, and very
fond of his children (a little too fond of his children, as
events proved). All of these traits endeared him to his people and to
the traders of the Hudson�s Bay Company.
But this was not enough to allay suspicion when he
returned from his winter camp in the spring of 1879 without his wife
and family. When he could not give a satisfactory account of their
whereabouts, his in-laws became worried. They decided to tell the
North West Mounted Police, who had then been in the West for just five
years.
Inspector S�v�re Gagnon was given the task of
investigating Swift Runner�s behavior. He and a small party of
policemen accordingly trekked out to the trapper�s camp.
Swift Runner obligingly showed the Mounted
Policemen a small grave near his camp. He explained that one of his
boys had died and was buried there. Gagnon and his detachment opened
the grave and found the bones undisturbed.
That, however, did not explain the human bones
scattered around the encampment. Gagnon produced a skull, which Swift
Runner willingly told him was that of his wife. Without much prodding,
Swift Runner revealed what had happened to the rest of his family.
At first, Swift Runner became haunted by dreams. A
Windigo spirit called on him to consume the people around him. The
spirit crept through his mind, gradually taking control. Finally he
was Windigo, and Swift Runner no longer. Then the Windigo killed and
ate Swift Runner�s wife.
This accomplished, the Windigo forced one of Swift
Runner�s boys to kill and butcher his younger brother. While enjoying
this grisly repast, the spirit hung Swift Runner�s infant by the neck
from a lodge pole and tugged at the baby�s dangling feet. It was later
shown that he had also done away with Swift Runner�s brother�and his
mother-in-law, though he acknowledged that she had been �a bit tough.�
The revolted Mounted Police party hauled Swift
Runner and the mutilated evidence back to Fort Saskatchewan. The trial
began on August 8, 1879. The judge and jury did not view the Windigo
idea in the same light as the Cree. They saw Swift Runner as a
murderer, and the trapper made no attempt to hide his guilt.
Stipendiary Magistrate Richardson quickly sentenced him to be hanged.
The sentence presented a problem: the police had
never before conducted an execution. Although the Hudson�s Bay Company
had once hanged an employee for murder, this was, for all intents and
purposes, the first formal execution in western Canada. Staff Sergeant
Fred Bagley, a force bugler, was put in charge of the arrangements.
A gallows was erected within the fort enclosure at
Fort Saskatchewan, and an old army pensioner named Rogers was made
hangman. On the appointed morning, a bitterly cold December 20, Swift
Runner was led to the scaffold.
Standing over the trap, the unrepentant cannibal
was given the opportunity to address the large crowd that had
gathered. He openly acknowledged his guilt, and thanked his jailers
for their kindness�then berated his guard for making him wait in the
cold!
Nevertheless, the Mounted Police must have
accomplished their first execution well enough. A more experienced
spectator, a California �forty-niner� named Jim Reade, commented,
�That�s the purtiest hangin� I ever seen, and it�s the twenty-ninth!�
Nowadays we view as psychosis what the Cree thought
to be the work of a Windigo spirit. At one time, in the belt of
parkland that borders the northern plains, it was far from being a
rare phenomenon. Usually the symptoms were the same as those displayed
by Swift Runner. And in one way or another, most of the afflicted
Windigos met similar, violent death.

Swift Runner&#39;s last walk
Man convicted of killing and eating his family
stayed calm despite delays and hitches in 1879 hanging
Jana G. Pruden, Edmonton Journal
Sunday, September 18 2011
It was pitch black and brutally cold when Swift
Runner was led from his cell at Fort Saskatchewan jail to start his
long, last walk toward the gallows that awaited outside in the
swirling snow.
Swift Runner, or Ka-Ki-Si-Kutchin, had been told to
prepare for death, and seemed to have heeded the advice. He walked
confidently into the yard, seeming much calmer than many of those who
were there to watch him die.
Most of the 60 people gathered near the gallows had
never seen a hanging, and they were nervous and anxious about what was
going to happen. Sheriff Edouard Richard had been delayed by the snow
and weather, and was flustered by his late arrival at the fort. The
hangman, too, appeared nervous.
The execution had been ordered to take place at 7:
30 a.m. on Dec. 20, 1879. With less than half an hour left to go, it
was discovered that the crowd had taken the trap from the gallows and
burned it as kindling, that the hangman had forgotten to bring straps
to bind the prisoner&#39;s arms.
As the sheriff and hangman rushed to get the
scaffold ready again, Swift Runner sat near one of the fires that had
been lighted nearby, joking and chatting, snacking on pemmican, the
thick noose hanging loose around his neck.
&#34;I could kill myself with a tomahawk,&#34; he offered,
&#34;and save the hangman further trouble.&#34;
Swift Runner was well-known around the Fort
Saskatchewan settlement, a striking 6-foot-3, with a strapping build
and what one policeman called &#34;as ugly and evil-looking a face as I
have ever seen.&#34;
He had once been known as smart and trustworthy, a
reputation that won him a job as a guide for the North West Mounted
Police. But, as one newspaper story would later point out: &#34;His
contact with white men, however, ruined him.&#34;
That ruination came, in part, from an inordinate
fondness for the whisky that was smuggled into the area disguised as
medicine. Swift Runner was known to be &#34;an ugly customer to meet when
on a spree,&#34; so ugly that some called him &#34;the terror of the whole
region.&#34;
The police sent Swift Runner back to his tribe,
where he caused so much trouble he &#34;turned the Cree camps into little
hells,&#34; and was eventually turned out from his community altogether,
retreating to the wilderness with his wife, mother, brother and six
children.
The police started to hear stories in the spring. A
Cree chief said Swift Runner had &#34;turned cannibal,&#34; and a hunter
reported that Swift Runner&#39;s entire family had been killed in the
woods, but a squad of officers who went out to investigate couldn&#39;t
find Swift Runner or his family.
Instead, Swift Runner went to the police himself in
the spring, telling them his wife had committed suicide and the rest
of the family had died of starvation.
But the officers noticed that Swift Runner didn&#39;t
look underfed.
&#34;The prisoner arrived at our camp in the spring and
did not look very poor or thin or as if he had been starving,&#34; one
noted.
Suspicious of the story, police travelled with
Swift Runner to his family&#39;s camp in the wilderness north of Fort
Saskatchewan. After days of searching, they found the remnants of a
campfire, with piles of bones and human skulls scattered nearby.
Some of the bones were dry and hollow, empty even
of marrow. A small moccasin had been stuffed inside the skull of Swift
Runner&#39;s mother, a beading needle still sticking out of the unfinished
work.
Swift Runner was tried for murder and cannibalism
by a jury that included three &#34;English speaking Cree half-breeds,&#34;
four men &#34;well up in the Cree language,&#34; and a Cree man who translated
the proceedings. A leading CreeEnglish scholar was also brought in to
observe the trial and ensure Swift Runner knew what was being said.
Swift Runner sat calmly throughout the testimony of
witnesses, who described the family being in perfect health when they
headed out to the woods, then Swift Runner coming out of the forest
alone.
&#34;He said I could not expect to see any of his
family because he was the only one left,&#34; said Kis-Sie-Ko-May.
There was no evidence presented in Swift Runner&#39;s
defence. Asked if he wanted to say anything, he responded: &#34;I did it.&#34;
The death sentence was to be the first legal
hanging in the Canadian Northwest Territories, an area that includes
what is now the province of Alberta. A scaffold was built especially
for the execution, and an army pensioner was paid $50 to serve as
hangman.
Swift Runner declined to spend the night before his
execution with a priest.
&#34;The white man has ruined me,&#34; he said. &#34;I don&#39;t
think their God could amount to much.&#34;
Some said Swift Runner had developed a taste for
cannibalism years earlier, when he was forced to eat the remains of a
starved hunting partner to save himself. Others said he had been
possessed by the Windigo, a flesheating spirit that tormented him and
gave him nightmares.
Two hours after Swift Runner was led to the
gallows, the execution was finally ready to proceed. He was allowed to
eat one final pound of pemmican before he was pinioned tightly with
rope and taken to the scaffold, where a thick, black hood was placed
over his head.
&#34;The trap fell, and Swift Runner went down with
fearful force, there being a drop of five feet,&#34; the Daily Evening
Mercury reported. &#34;He died without a struggle. The body was cut down
in an hour and buried in the snow outside the fort.&#34;
Sheriff Edouard Richard said those who attended the
hanging were satisfied with what they saw.
&#34;Seeing that the Indians are averse to hanging and
that all sorts of rumours were afloat amongst them and half-breeds
about deeds of cruelty that were to accompany the execution,
invitations had been tendered to Indian Chiefs to assist at the
execution,&#34; he wrote in a report to the government. &#34;Some of them
responded to the invitation and declared that it was done in such a
way that they could no more object to that mode of execution.&#34;
One witness, who had watched several other
executions in the United States, also seemed pleased with the
spectacle, slapping his thigh and saying, &#34;Boys, it was the prettiest
hanging I ever seen.&#34;

The Wendigo (also known as Windigo,
Weendigo, Windago, Waindigo, Windiga,
Witiko, Wihtikow, and numerous other variants) is a
mythical creature appearing in the mythology of the Algonquian people.
It is a malevolent cannibalistic spirit into which humans could
transform, or which could possess humans. Those who indulged in
cannibalism were at particular risk, and the legend appears to have
reinforced this practice as a taboo.
Wendigo psychosis is the name conventionally
given to a culture-bound disorder which involved an intense craving
for human flesh and the fear that the sufferer would turn into a
cannibal. This once occurred frequently among Algonquian Native
cultures, but has declined due to the Native American urbanization.
Recently the Wendigo has also become a horror
entity of contemporary literature and film, much like the vampire,
werewolf, or zombie, although these fictional depictions often bear
little resemblance to the original entity.
In Algonquian
mythology
The Wendigo is part of the traditional belief
systems of various Algonquian-speaking tribes in the northern United
States and Canada, most notably the Ojibwe and Saulteaux, the Cree,
the Naskapi and the Innu people. Though descriptions varied somewhat,
common to all these cultures was the conception of Wendigos as
malevolent, cannibalistic, supernatural beings (manitous) of great
spiritual power. They were strongly associated with the Winter, the
North, and coldness, as well as with famine and starvation. Basil
Johnston, an Ojibwe teacher and scholar from Ontario, gives one
description of how Wendigos were viewed:
&#34;The Weendigo was gaunt to the point of
emaciation, its desiccated skin pulled tautly over its bones. With
its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash gray
of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the
Weendigo looked like a gaunt skeleton recently disinterred from the
grave. What lips it had were tattered and bloody [....] Unclean and
suffering from suppurations of the flesh, the Weendigo gave off a
strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and
corruption.&#34;
At the same time, Wendigos were embodiments of
gluttony, greed, and excess: never satisfied after killing and
consuming one person, they were constantly searching for new victims.
In some traditions, humans who became overpowered by greed could turn
into Wendigos; the Wendigo myth thus served as a method of encouraging
cooperation and moderation.
Among the Ojibwe, Eastern Cree, Westmain Swampy
Cree, Naskapi, and Innu, Wendigos were said to be giants, many times
larger than human beings (a characteristic absent from the Wendigo
myth in the other Algonquian cultures). Whenever a Wendigo ate another
person, it would grow in proportion to the meal it had just eaten, so
that it could never be full. Wendigos were therefore simultaneously
constantly gorging themselves and emaciated from starvation
Human Wendigos
All cultures in which the Wendigo myth appeared
shared the belief that human beings could turn into Wendigos if they
ever resorted to cannibalism or, alternatively, become possessed by
the demonic spirit of a Wendigo, often in a dream. Once transformed, a
person would become violent and obsessed with eating human flesh. The
most frequent cause of transformation into a Wendigo was if a person
had resorted to cannibalism, consuming the body of another human in
order to keep from starving to death during a time of extreme hardship
or famine.
Among northern Algonquian cultures, cannibalism,
even to save one&#39;s own life, was viewed as a serious taboo; the proper
response to famine was suicide or resignation to death. On one level,
the Wendigo myth thus worked as a deterrent and a warning against
resorting to cannibalism; those who did would become Wendigo monsters
themselves.
Wendigo ceremony
Among the Assiniboine, the Cree and the Ojibwe, a
satirical ceremonial dance was originally performed during times of
famine to reinforce the seriousness of the Wendigo taboo. The
ceremonial dance, known as a wiindigookaanzhimowin in Ojibwe
and today performed as part of the last day activities of the Sun
Dance, involves wearing a mask and dancing about the drum backwards.
The last known Wendigo Ceremony conducted in the United States was at
Lake Windigo of Star Island of Cass Lake, located within the Leech
Lake Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota.
Wendigo psychosis
The term &#34;Wendigo psychosis&#34; (also spelled many
other ways, including &#34;Windigo psychosis&#34; and &#34;Witiko psychosis&#34;)
refers to a condition in which sufferers developed an insatiable
desire to eat human flesh even when other food sources were readily
available, often as a result of prior famine cannibalism. Wendigo
psychosis has traditionally been identified by Western psychologists
as a culture-bound syndrome, though there is a debate over the
existence of phenomenon as a genuine disorder. The theory was popular
primarily among psychologists in the early 1900s, and may have
resulted from a misinterpretation of northern Algonquian myths and
culture.
In accounts of Wendigo psychosis, members of the
aboriginal communities in which it existed believed that cases
literally involved individuals turning into Wendigos. Such individuals
generally recognized these symptoms as meaning that they were turning
into Wendigos, and often requested to be executed before they could
harm others. The most common response when someone began suffering
from Wendigo psychosis was curing attempts by traditional native
healers or Western doctors. In the unusual cases where these attempts
failed, and the Wendigo began either to threaten those around them or
to act violently or anti-socially, they were then generally executed.
Cases of Wendigo psychosis, though evidently real, were relatively
rare, and it was even rarer for them to actually culminate in the
execution of the sufferer.
One of the more famous cases of Wendigo psychosis
involved a Plains Cree trapper from Alberta, named Swift Runner.
During the winter of 1878, Swift Runner and his family were starving,
and his eldest son died. Twenty-five miles away from emergency food
supplies at a Hudson&#39;s Bay Company post, Swift Runner butchered and
ate his wife and five remaining children. Given that he resorted to
cannibalism so near to food supplies, and that he killed and consumed
the remains of all those present, it was revealed that Swift Runner&#39;s
was not a case of pure cannibalism as a last resort to avoid
starvation, but rather of a man suffering from Wendigo psychosis.
He eventually confessed and was executed by
authorities at Fort Saskatchewan. Another well-known case involving
Wendigo psychosis was that of Jack Fiddler, an Oji-Cree chief and
shaman known for his powers at defeating Wendigos. In some cases this
entailed euthanizing people suffering from Wendigo psychosis; as a
result, in 1907, Fiddler and his brother Joseph were arrested by the
Canadian authorities for murder. Jack committed suicide, but Joseph
was tried and sentenced to life in prison. He was ultimately granted a
pardon, but died three days later in jail before receiving the news of
this pardon.
Fascination with Wendigo psychosis among Western
ethnographers, psychologists, and anthropologists led to a hotly
debated controversy in the 1980s over the historicity of this
phenomenon. Some researchers argued that Wendigo psychosis was
essentially a fabrication, the result of na�ve anthropologists taking
stories related to them at face value. Others have pointed to a number
of credible eyewitness accounts, both by Algonquians and by
Westerners, as evidence that Wendigo psychosis was a factual
historical phenomenon.
The frequency of Wendigo psychosis cases decreased
sharply in the 20th century as Boreal Algonquian people came in to
greater and greater contact with Western ideologies and more
sedentary, less rural lifestyles. While there is some substantive
evidence to suggest that Wendigo psychosis did exist, a number of
questions concerning the condition remain unanswered, and there is
continuing debate over its nature, significance, and prevalence.
References in popular
culture
While Wendigos have been referred to in literature
for many decades (most notably in Algernon Blackwood&#39;s 1910 story &#34;The
Wendigo,&#34; which introduced the legend to horror fiction, and in
Stephen King&#39;s novel Pet Sematary), recently they have become
something of a stock character in horror and fantasy films and
television, along the lines of werewolves and vampires, usually
bearing very little resemblance to the Algonquian spirit. Appearances
include the movies Wendigo and Ravenous, and in episodes
of the television series Blood Ties Charmed, Supernatural,
Haven and others.
They also appear as characters in a number of
computer and video games, including Final Fantasy, The
Legend of Dragoon, and the Warcraft Universe, as well as
role-playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Additionally,
there is a Marvel Comics character known as &#34;Wendigo&#34;.
They are referenced in music as well: the Cree
singer-songwriter Buffy Sainte-Marie&#39;s song &#34;The Priests Of The Golden
Bull&#34; asserts that the &#34;money junkies&#34; of the world are Wendigos.
