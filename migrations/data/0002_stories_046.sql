Sault police say two dead, gunshots fired on Goulais Avenue

Sault police say two dead, gunshots fired on Goulais Avenue
Sault Ste. Marie police say two people are dead at the scene of a residential fire on Goulais Avenue.
&#34;A victim was found in the driveway of a residence, taken to hospital, and was later pronounced deceased at hospital,&#34; police said Friday morning.
&#34;Another victim was located in a residence that was on fire and was pronounced deceased at the scene. The cause of death of the two people remains under investigation, but police can confirm gunshots occurred.&#34;
“We do have, unfortunately, two people who have succumbed to injuries as a result of this incident. There were reports of gunfire which we are able to confirm, that there was gunfire during the incident. The cause of death for both the victims is still under investigation.” said Lincoln Louttit, manager of Corporate Communications, Planning and Research with the Sault Ste. Marie Police Service.
Police said they believe this to be an isolated incident &#34;as the people involved are known to each other.&#34;
“Every investigation is different. Obviously we’ll do our best, detectives will do their best to determine a cause of death as soon as they can to provide some of that closure to the next of kin. But at this time I can’t give you a timeframe for when we’ll have that information,” added Louttit.
This story will be updated as more information comes available.
Story updated with reports from the field by Mike McDonald.
Original story:
Emergency crews in Sault Ste. Marie are currently on the scene of a residential fire on Goulais Avenue.
&#34;This is an active incident and community members are urged to avoid the area to allow first responders to focus on the scene,&#34; police said in a news release Friday morning.
Upon arrival at the fire, responders found an injured person in a driveway and they were taken to hospital.
&#34;During the initial investigation it was determined the person was assaulted,&#34; police said.
&#34;Officers are actively investigating and remain on scene as this is an active incident. Further details will be provided as they become available.&#34;

Fire marshal investigating cause of Goulais Avenue blaze
The Ontario Fire Marshal&#39;s Office is helping with an investigation into an incident that happened on Goulais Avenue in Sault Ste. Marie on Friday, which resulted in a fire and two deaths.
Two residences, directly beside each other, were involved, but the fire took place at just one of them, Lincoln Louttit, a Sault police spokesperson, told CTV News in an email Monday morning.
The Ontario Fire Marshal was at the scene on the weekend and is investigating the cause of the blaze.
Autopsies are scheduled for the two victims this week to determine the cause of death.
The victims have been identified, but their names are not being released at this time, Louttit said.
When emergency crews arrived Friday, one of the victims was found injured in the driveway after being assaulted, police said.
The individual was taken to hospital and later pronounced deceased.
The other victim was found inside a residence that was on fire and was pronounced dead at the scene, Louttit told CTV News Friday.
At some point during the incident, gunshots were fired, he said.
Adding, it is believed to be an isolated incident among people known to each other.
&#34;Officers remain on scene as the investigation continues,&#34; police said.
