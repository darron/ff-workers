Photograph: Canadian Press/Rex/ShutterstockMcFee identified the deceased officers as Travis Jordan, 35, who had been with the Edmonton force for eight-and-a-half years, and Brett Ryan, 30, an officer for five-and-a-half years.“I can’t tell you how devastated we are with their loss,” McFee said.Ryan was being remembered as a pillar of the community and a longtime youth league hockey referee. Darcy Carter, with the Spruce Grove Minor Hockey Association, said the officer and his wife were expecting a child.Ryan was a paramedic before he became a police officer, and was passionate about his work in the police, Carter said. “That’s something that I’ll never forget … just his face lighting up when he talked about his job.”Jordan was remembered for his kindness. Jessica Shmigelsky said she was driving to work after a heavy spring snowfall in 2020 and Jordan pulled her over because her snow brush wasn’t working.
