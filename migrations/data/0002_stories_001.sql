The Thomas Easby Murders in 1829 — Foulest Ever in Lanark County

The Thomas Easby Murders in 1829 Foulest Ever in Lanark County- Perth Courier
In Perth, 1829 has a heinous ring to its history for it was the year that one of the county’s foulest murders was committed.  The late W.B. Hart of Perth is responsible for the tale of Thomas Easby being told. Mr. Hart in (date illegible) gave the Perth Municipal Museum a copy of the Bathurst Independent Examiner—Perth’s pioneer paper.  Between the pages of the 1829 Examiner the story of the murders unfolds.
Thomas Easby was a pioneer who, with his wife and five children, lived in a log cabin on the 9th Concession of Drummond—on the main highway between Perth and Lanark Village.  There, on an early December night in 1829 the tale begins.
What exactly transpired within the walls of that house on that night is not known.  But it was discovered the next day that Easby’s wife and four children were dead and the log cabin was burned to the ground.
Although many neighbors suspected Easby of  murdering the five and then burning down the house, nothing could be proved.  The only surviving Easby child, however, added fuel to the already growing flames.
The survivor—a four year old boy—was adopted by a neighboring family, a Mr. and Mrs. Richardson.  On one occasion when  Mrs. Richardson was building a fire under a soap cooler (kettle), the child remarked: “That is what daddy did to mommy”.
Eventually local authorities had the bodies disinterred and Dr. James Wilson examined the remains—apparently something seemed a little fishy.  He had a warrant issued for Easby’s arrest and on Feb. 2 the soon to be convicted murderer was lodged in the Perth jail to await trial.
The trial began on August 21.  Easby, however, was only charged with one murder….that of his wife.  This deed was all the more deplorable because Ann was pregnant at the time of her death.
The chief crown witness (of the eight called) was John Tullis, a neighboring farmer.  Tullis testified that he had awakened about midnight on the night in question by a loud shriek.  His mother saw the Easby cabin on fire and another son, Sinclair, went over to investigate.  On approaching the hut, Sinclair Tullis was told by Easby that the fire was extinguished and that everything was alright.  As a result, the Tullis boy went home.
However, at day break, as the Examiner article recalled, “he (Sinclair Tullis) returned to the miserable hovel—when Easby informed him that all the family except himself and little Joseph were burned up in the cellar”.
Mrs. Richardson, Joseph’s adopted mother, also took the stand.  She testified that while “at first she did not suspect Easby, the child’s prattle worried her and she finally consulted their neighbor John Balderson regarding her fears.”
Dr. Wilson—another Crown witness, stated that he found four distinct head wounds “on the wife’s head—one or two of which could have caused immediate death.”  Then the nail was really driven into the coffin.  John Balderson swore that the suspect had admitted while in jail to the murder.  The jailer, James Young, also testified “that Easby had frequently confessed to him and stated that he was about to murder the remaining child also and had taken him in his arms for that purpose but the youngster smiled and laughter in his face and that he had not the heart to execute him”.
With such a preponderance of evidence the jury had little difficulty in reaching a verdict.  They returned from the jury room in a matter of minutes and the foreman intoned the guilty verdict on Easby. Easby was sent to death and hanged less than one week later.
But the post script to the case is worth noting.  As revealed in the Examiner “the body of this felon had been buried in the English Church Cemetery but owing to the excitement and strong feeling evinced by the crowd which witnessed the execution and the fear of reprisals the remains were exhumed that night and handed over to Dr. Wilson and two medical students for dissection”.
The gruesome account continues:  “they first skinned the body and the hide was tanned in a local tannery and cut up into small squares which were sold to the public bringing as much as $2. Talk about your early murder memorabilia! The skeleton remained in the possession of Dr. Wilson till after his death and sold to a local Perth lad who took it west with him.
That was the end of Thomas Easby—one of Canada’s first convicted multiple murderers.
Also read-Fame and Murder Came to Balderson in 1828
First Execution for Murder – Thomas Easby, of Drummond township, 1829; found to have killed his wife and four children, publicly hanged at Perth after rejection of defence of insanity.
“Tell me dad how did you meet mom ? Was it a church social, a wedding, were you school sweethearts ? No son, I met your dear mother at a public hanging ” – Maybe true romance is dead after all ?

Henry and Polly Sovereign lived in a log house on Concession 5, Lot 1, Windham Township. Many of their neighbours were their extended family. Sovereign killed his wife and seven of their children, and was hanged for the crime at the London court house.




Henry Sovereign	Henry Sovereign committed what is considered the first – and the worst – mass murder in Ontario. It was 1832, and the middle of winter in Windham Township. During the night on January 22, Sovereign ran to his uncle-in-law&#39;s house and told him two intruders had attacked his home. They rushed back, only to find the mangled bodies of Sovereign&#39;s wife Polly and seven of their children. He became the prime suspect when the murder weapons were found on his farm. Sovereign was known to drink, and people speculated he murdered his family in a drunken rage. Despite his claims of innocence, he was hanged in London on August 13, 1832.	To learn more about Sovereign&#39;s crime and the consequences, read below.Country life	Henry Sovereign (also spelled Sovereene) was born around 1788 in New Jersey, in the United States, but his family moved to Upper Canada in 1799. By 1812, Sovereign had created a good life for himself: he was married to Mary Beemer (who went by Polly) and he owned land in Windham Township in Norfolk County.However, in 1819, he ended up in court, where he was found guilty of killing a horse and was sentenced to hang. Judges took liberties with these unnecessarily harsh old laws, and this time Sovereign escaped the noose.	The next thirteen years passed by uneventfully. Sovereign and his wife Polly raised their eleven children, and he provided for them by working as a farmer and shingle weaver. Those who knew the family said he was &#34;rather affectionate to his wife and children&#34; – except when he was drinking. Under the influence of alcohol, Sovereign was angry and abusive.		The murder occurred in Windham Township, Norfolk County, but Sovereign was imprisoned, tried, and executed in London.	&#34;Most atrocious murder&#34;	In the early hours of January 23, Sovereign ran to his uncle-in-law&#39;s and told him that two men with black-painted faces had broken into his home, and he feared for his family&#39;s safety. The two men, accompanied by several other neighbours, hurried back to Sovereign&#39;s house. Inside they found the dead bodies of two of his children, while an infant lay half-burnt in the fireplace. A fourth child, who was still alive, succumbed to her injuries later. Outside, the corpses of his wife and several children lay between the house and a shed. Witnesses said there was so much blood it had melted through the snow. The four remaining children survived; one was in the house unharmed, and the three oldest were away from home.	Constable John Massacer soon arrived, and noticed that Sovereign kept walking by his wife&#39;s body as if looking for something. When the constable investigated, he found a bloody blade on the ground. The handle lay separately nearby, and the men realized it had belonged to one of Sovereign&#39;s sons.Suspicious of the circumstances, Massacer arrested Sovereign and discovered a bloody jack-knife in his pocket. Another search of the house turned up a gory broomstick and a maul, hidden in the bed, that was &#34;nearly covered with human hair of different colours.&#34;	Newspapers across Upper Canada and even in the United States reported the crime in horrifying detail. Reverend Ryerson&#39;s account was published in a New York paper, where he described seeing the scene of the murders and meeting Polly&#39;s distraught family, who questioned, &#34;Did you ever witness such a sight? Who would believe that any man could come to this?&#34;		The London Sun, a local paper run by Edward Allen Talbot, reported on the sensational murders [left]. The Evening Star, a New York City newspaper, published Rev. Ryerson&#39;s description of the crime and its aftermath [right].	Justice hangs in the balance	Sovereign spent seven long months at the jail in London before finally going on trial on August 8, 1832. This trial focused on the murder of his wife Polly, not the children (Elizabeth, Effy, David, Julia, Susan, Job, and Polly). It was a landmark case not only because of the scale of the murders, but also because the proceedings were written down in the earliest known record of an assize trial in London.	The prosecution called as witnesses the neighbours who had accompanied Sovereign and found the bodies, as well as a doctor who performed the autopsies. He testified that Polly&#39;s fatal wound, which passed through her liver and aorta, matched the knife found beside her. Furthermore, he said that the position of Sovereign&#39;s minor injuries on his arm and chest meant they could only have been self-inflicted, to add credibility to the story of intruders.	Sovereign told the jury &#34;my life is now in your hands and…I can only now assure you of my innocence,&#34; but he did not answer the key questions. Why had he abandoned his family to the intruders instead of defending them? What was the strangers&#39; motive for murdering a random family in the night? Why would the killers rely on finding weapons at the house instead of bringing their own? The jury returned with the verdict in less than an hour: guilty.		One of the murder weapons was a maul such as this one, used for splitting wood and shingles.	&#34;Awful eternity&#34;	Sovereign was tried and convicted on a Wednesday, but his hanging was scheduled for the following Monday, August 13, 1832. The owner of the London Sun, who had recorded the trial, came to visit the convict. He felt &#34;an indescribable thrill of horror&#34; as the door clanged shut behind him, leaving him in Sovereign&#39;s dark cell. The newspaperman wrote that, &#34;His hair, which was full and bushy, was perfectly white, although his age did not exceed 50. His eye brows and lashes were dark, his forehead was high and capacious, but projected too much over the face…His beard, which was closely shaved the day of his trial, had grown considerably.&#34;	 On Monday, around 300 Londoners came to watch the execution,  the second one to take place in the city. It was a smaller crowd than attended the first hanging, as a cholera outbreak was ending. Sovereign approached the scaffold and asked the sheriff if he should remove his shoes. His lawyer yelled from the crowd, &#34;For God&#39;s sake Sovereign, confess. Don&#39;t die with a lie in your mouth!&#34; He got no response. In his sentencing, the judge had told Sovereign that &#34;with a most remorseless ferosity [sic] you have hurried [your family] into an awful eternity,&#34; and Sovereign still did not repent or admit his crime. Instead, he calmly ascended the scaffold, and joined his wife and children in that &#34;awful eternity.&#34;London&#39;s court house had only been built three years earlier, in 1829, but it was already clear that the region had enough criminals to justify its existence. And not just petty criminals, but a mass murderer the likes of which had not been seen before. Londoners came out to see the executions to satisfy a morbid curiosity, and also, perhaps, to reassure themselves that there was now one less threat walking the streets of Victorian London - streets that were no less dangerous than they are now.Sources	Primary Sources	&#34;Horrible Sacrifice of Human Life.&#34; The London Sun (London, Ontario), Jan. 26, 1832.

The late Upper Canada papers contain an account the murder of a mother and six children, and the strongest suspicion ol this act rests upon Henry Sovereign, the tathf of the family. The following particn ars are from the pen of the Rev. Mr. Ejeron A general horror has been excited in the minds olih of tbeTLondon Disinet.iK rtn.iiu. of one of the most atrocious and unnatural cnm everstauied the history of man it is the murder of a roomer, una six, not seven children I will briefly state the artirulars of this dark and bloody transaction, as detailed to me by the deeply afflicted Father and Brother mi the murdered Woman, and also by ou ol the Corouer&#39;s jury that investigates! it The principal evidence, i am informal bor, who lived between a quarter and a half a mila (rem the place where the murder stated that on Mondjy raornini. the 2 1st instant, soma time before day, Henry Sovt reign, the father of the uuruereu lara.iy. came to bouse, slightly wounded the breast and lelt rm. thai deters at his (Sovereicn&#39;s1! house and ih or expected tbey wouid kill his wile and lamily.Tbe neignbur. in company with Sovereign, came with all possible haste to the place.

A fourth was found out ol d.a ik. truer of the house.lifeless, and hloedm ground. About a rod a from the house, in a path which led to an old hovel, was seen a fifth in the u.ns state. Nearly a rod laxther in the same path was found a young wman, about 17 years of age, a corpse, la the yard in trout of the hovel, lay the mother and a little boy close together, weltering in their blood. Close by the mother was observed the blade of a knife all bloody. It was found on examination, that she had received a blow oa the back of her neck, which fractured her skull and dislocated her neck bow, and had also been stat.ted in the pit ol the stomach, so as to pierce the vitals, and divide one of the lam arteries, which bled most Drofuseir.The knife fc.Ud was immediately challenged as Sovereign&#39;s, and the unfortunate woman&#39;s brother declared that be had frequently seen it at his (Sovereign&#39;s) boase. Search being made, the handle of the knife was found about two rods from the place where the blade lay. and it was said that sovereign had been seen a few days before putting a rivet in the sell same handle.
