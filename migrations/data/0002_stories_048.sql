More details are beginning to emerge this morning about the circumstances around a police-involved shooting in Innisfil last night that left three people dead, including two South Simcoe police officers.
The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) is on the scene this morning investigating what led to the shooting death of a 23-year-old man in the Alcona area on Tuesday night. The man&#39;s name has not been released, nor have the names of the two officers who were killed.
The SIU has assigned six investigators and three forensic investigators to the case.
Somers Boulevard in Alcona is a seemingly sleepy little street in the northeast end of Innisfil, with single-family homes, large, well-kept front lawns and long driveways. Its trees have changed colour.
Now Somers is lined with several police vehicles, both marked and unmarked, plus what looks like the SIU mobile command centre.
Yellow police tape stretches across Somers Boulevard until at least Happy Vale Drive.
At around 8 p.m., on Tuesday, Oct. 11, officers were called to a residence in the area of Somers Boulevard and Happy Vale Drive near 25th Sideroad and 9th Line for a &#34;disturbance.&#34;
In a video obtained by InnisfilToday of a neighbour&#39;s security camera footage, 20 loud gunshots can be heard in the background.
Inside the residence, the SIU says there was an exchange of gunfire between the man and the officers. The man was pronounced deceased at the scene. Two officers were rushed to the hospital where they both succumbed to their injuries.
The SIU is urging anyone who may have information, including video or photos, to contact the lead investigator at 1-800-787-8529 or online here.
South Simcoe police will be making a statement on the case at Innisfil Town Hall this afternoon at 1 p.m.
The SIU is an independent government agency that investigates incidents that may have resulted in death, serious injury, sexual assault and/or the discharge of a firearm at a person.

A source close to the investigation has identified the shooter as Christopher Doncaster; on social media, he is identified as a one-time member of the Canadian Armed Forces.By Janis RamsayReporterChris SimonReporterAlyshah HashamCourts ReporterBetsy PowellCourts ReporterBrett GloverWed., Oct. 12, 2022timer6 min. readupdateArticle was updated Oct. 14, 2022Just weeks after Ontario police officers gathered twice to mourn two of their own, they lined the highways and streets once again — this time to honour Const. Devon Northrup, 33, and Const. Morgan Russell, 54, the officers killed Tuesday night in a shocking “exchange of gunfire” inside a home on a quiet residential street near  Lake Simcoe.“Words cannot describe our grief,” South Simcoe Police Service Acting Chief John Van Dyke said at an emotional news conference at Innisfil Town Hall on Wednesday. Later, about 150 members of the community held a vigil at a local church for the slain officers. The two officers were shot “upon arrival” to a call about a disturbance inside the Innisfil home at around 8 p.m. Tuesday, Van Dyke said. According to the Special Investigations Unit, the shooter, a 23-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene after an “exchange of gunfire” with the South Simcoe officers.Residents of Innisfil, Ont. are in shock after two officers died following a shooting at a home in the community north of Toronto. A 23-year-old man involved in the shooting also died. Acting police chief John Van Dyke said it is a heartbreaking time for the police service. (OCT. 12 / THE CANADIAN PRESS)A source close to the investigation has identified the shooter to the Star as Christopher Doncaster; a man with that name is listed as a resident of the home on Somers Boulevard through court and loan records.Multiple neighbours confirmed to Simcoe.com that Doncaster lived at the home with his grandmother. In a 2020 social media post, Doncaster’s grandmother identifies Christopher Joseph Doncaster as a private with the Canadian Armed Forces.A spokesperson for the Department of National Defence told the Star in an email: “We can confirm having someone by the name of Christopher Joseph Doncaster, who was a CAF member from May to December 2020 ... He was a Private with no deployment history.”The SIU, which investigates all deaths involving Ontario police, has not identified the shooter, saying his family did not consent to the release of his name. SIU spokesperson Kristy Denette confirmed the dead man was a resident of the home, and said someone from the home made the initial call to police about a disturbance involving the man. She did not confirm whether he was killed by the responding officers or took his own life.“There is an autopsy scheduled for Friday that will hopefully be able to shed some more light on the cause and the manner of this man’s death,” she said.Denette confirmed the gun recovered at the scene was an SKS semi-automatic rifle. It was not immediately clear whether the weapon was legally owned. The Liberal government was criticized in 2020 after the SKS, used in a double homicide in B.C. in 2019, was not part of a ban on many semi-automatic guns.On Wednesday morning, yellow crime scene tape could be seen criss-crossing the road outside the home located a few blocks from Lake Simcoe, lined with tall trees, detached homes and wide driveways.A witness who lives nearby told reporters they heard several shots Tuesday night. “They were in such quick succession,” the man said. “It was ‘pop, pop, pop, pop, pop’ — very quick.”The wounded officers were rushed to a local hospital, where Northrup died. Russell was airlifted to St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, but also died.Northrup, a six-year member of the service assigned to the community mobilization and engagement unit, and Russell, a 33-year veteran of the service and trained crisis negotiator who was assigned to uniform patrol, are the third and fourth Ontario police officers to be killed in the last four weeks. Toronto police Const. Andrew Hong was shot dead at a Tim Hortons while getting coffee last month and York Regional Police Const. Travis Gillespie was killed in a head-on crash on the way to work. “Const. Northrup is survived by his partner, his parents and his many close friends within the service and in the community,” Van Dyke said. “He also served as a member of our mental health crisis outreach and support team and the emergency response unit.” Russell leaves his wife and two adult children.A gofundme was set up hours after the shootings to help the slain officers’ families. “This is personal for me,” Van Dyke said at the Wednesday news conference, veering off his prepared remarks. “I went to police college with Morgan 33 years ago.”’He added that York Regional Police have been asked to investigate the circumstances of this incident.“We recognize that the community has questions, as do we.”After the news conference, Innisfil Mayor Lynn Dollin told reporters it would be an understatement to say the community is devastated.“Innisfil and Bradford are small towns, so Simcoe Police are beloved in our communities, so well respected by everyone. We’re just broken,” Dollin said, her lower lip quivering.“It’s a dark day and it’s going to take us a long time to process this but we will be there to support our South Simcoe police colleagues and ... the impacted families and friends.”In a statement, the Police Association of Ontario described the killings of Northrup and Russell as a “stark reminder of the dangers our members put themselves in every day to protect the communities they serve. This is a reminder of the unwavering courage, bravery and devotion they display every time they put on their uniform.” The bodies of both officers were taken under escort to the Ontario Coroner’s office in Toronto, where autopsies are anticipated.En route, colleagues from several nearby police services lined highway overpasses to salute their fallen comrades.Later, on Wednesday evening, there were hushed tones and some tears in the sanctuary of Innisfil Community Church during a vigil organized for the slain officers.For lead pastor Steve Bradley, the vigil was an opportunity for Innisfil and all those affected by the officers’ deaths to grieve together.“It is a beautiful thing,” Bradley told the Star of the community supporting each other during tragedy. “It’s through prayer, through stories and through conversations with one another (that) we try to find a way to move forward.”RELATED STORIESGTAAt Const. Andrew Hong’s funeral, grief for a family man who was living his dreamSep. 21, 2022About 150 people gathered inside the church;. Some laid flowers at the front of the sanctuary while others stood in silence, heads bowed, holding battery-powered tea lights.“One of the greatest gifts that this church has is community. And you may not know it right now, but you and I need community, not for all the answers, but for the support,” Bradley said during the vigil.He referenced a Bible verse that says “no one has greater love than this, to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”“Last night, Const. Devon Northrup and Const. Morgan Russell showed us that love,” he said.Social media accounts belonging to a Chris Doncaster linked to the Innisfil home appear to show a young man who was interested in mixed martial arts and popular first-person shooter video games. Photos taken this year show him with friends, flashing luxury clothing items. He describes himself as an “entrepreneur.” In one nighttime photo, posted to Instagram in September 2021, Doncaster can be seen smiling as he sits on a South Simcoe police Jet Ski, tied up at a dock.In 2018 Doncaster was charged with mischief under $5,000, and two counts of failing to appear in court. The charges were withdrawn. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted Wednesday: “I’m sending my deepest condolences to @SouthSimcoePS this morning, as they mourn the passing of two officers who were killed in the line of duty. My thoughts are also with the loved ones of these officers and the entire Innisfil community.”Premier Doug Ford tweeted that he was “heartbroken.” He added: “We are praying for the officers’ families and all the police officers who put their lives on the line to protect our communities.”Ontario Premier Doug Ford visited the South Simcoe police detachment in Innisfil, Ont. on Wednesday afternoon after two officers died in a shooting. Ford said the loss of the officers is a &#34;senseless tragedy.&#34; (OCT. 12 / THE CANADIAN PRESS)With files from Wendy Gillis and Eli RidderJRJanis Ramsay is an award-winning journalist covering Simcoe County for more than 22 years.

What we know about suspected Innisfil police killer Chris Doncaster

Phil Tsekouras, CTV News Toronto Multi-Platform Writer
@PhilTsekouras
Published Thursday, October 13, 2022 5:13PM EDT
Last Updated Thursday, October 13, 2022 5:13PM EDT
More details are emerging about the man suspected of killing two police officers at an Ontario home on Tuesday night.
While Ontario’s police watchdog has not yet identified the shooter, several family friends and an ex-girlfriend who spoke with CTV News Toronto on Wednesday confirmed him to be 23-year-old resident Chris Doncaster.
This is everything we know about him.
WHERE DID HE LIVE?
Doncaster was living with his grandparents at the home near 25th Sideroad and 9th Line, less than one kilometre away from Lake Simcoe, leading up to the Oct. 11 shooting.
The area is described by neighbours as residential, typically quiet, and safe.
TIME IN THE MILITARY
In an email to CTV News, the Canadian Armed Forces confirmed a man named Christopher Joseph Doncaster was a member from May to December in 2020.
A spokesperson for the CAF said he was a Private with no deployment history and did not complete basic training. Images posted on Facebook in November 2020 by Doncaster’s grandmother show him in uniform and a certificate of enlistment is dated May 14, 2020.
WHAT GUN WAS USED IN THE SHOOTING?
According to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the gun used by Doncaster in the shooting was a SKS semi-automatic rifle.
The rifle itself is legal to buy in Canada and is not included in the federal government’s list of prohibited assault-style firearms.
They are known by collectors as cheap military rifles which were used in the Eastern Bloc in the 1950s and sold in surplus channels in Canada.
A firearms license is required to buy an SKS. A single round fired from the rifle could cause significant injury due to the size of the ammunition
It’s unclear if Doncaster was the legal owner of the firearm or if it was registered.
The same type of gun was also used by 19-year-old Kam McLeod and 18-year-old Bryer Schmegelsky during their three killings in 2019 in northern British Columbia.
ACTIVITY ON SOCIAL MEDIA
Doncaster had recently created an account on Twitch, a popular video game live-streaming service, where he posted videos under the name “1CpMaster1.”
As recently as Oct. 7, Doncaster posted two separate videos where he streamed himself watching a podcast, and playing the popular first-person shooter games Call of Duty: Warzone, Destiny 2, and Overwatch 2.
In a tweet published Oct. 3, Doncaster pitched a Bitcoin giveaway in an effort to boost his online presence.
“If I reach 50k followers I’ll be giving away 10k in bitcoin live on stream more #Giveaway on the way soon,” the tweet read.
His twitter feed also shows an apparent affinity for the city of Toronto and their sports teams.
After the 2018 van attack in North York, Doncaster retweeted a number of posts that expressed their condolences following the attack.
In the summer, he retweeted a post by tech executive Elon Musk that read: “Much harder to make friends than enemies. My skill at the latter is improving.”
Doncaster described himself as an “entrepreneur” on both his Twitter and Instagram platforms.
DID HE HAVE A CRIMINAL HISTORY?
According to court records obtained by The Canadian Press, Doncaster was charged with mischief under $5,000 in October 2018 and two counts of failure to appear in court.
However, all three charges were withdrawn in June of the following year.
WHO CALLED POLICE TO THE HOME?
The SIU said officers were called to the area shortly before 8 p.m. and that family members inside the home made the call to police.
It’s unclear who exactly made the call or what was discussed with the dispatcher.
WHAT HAPPENED, ACCORDING TO THE SIU
Initially, SIU said Const. Devon Northrup, 33, and Const. Morgan Russell, 54, arrived at the home and became involved in an “exchange of gunfire” with a 23-year-old male resident armed with a semi-automatic rifle.
Northrup and Russell were critically injured in the shooting and were rushed to hospitals, but both later died of their injuries.
On Thursday, the SIU stated told CTV News Toronto a third officer was at the house and was the one who exchanged gunfire with the 23-year-old man.
HOW DID DONCASTER DIE?
It is not yet known how Doncaster was killed.
The SIU has said investigators will know more following an autopsy scheduled for Friday.

Toronto police appeal for witnesses, info to fatal triple shooting in North York

Last Updated Tuesday, October 11, 2022 6:30AM EDT
Toronto police are appealing for information and witnesses after three men were shot, one fatally, at an indoor soccer and basketball facility in North York over the Thanksgiving weekend.
Gunshots rang out shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday at La Liga Sports Complex, near Finch Avenue West and Alness Street, just west of Dufferin Street.
Edwin Farley Alvarado Quintero, 49, of Woodbrige, was rushed to a local trauma centre, but died of his injuries there on Monday morning. He is the city’s 56th homicide victim of the year.
The two other victims were also taken to hospital, one with life-threatening injuries. The other person’s inuries were described by police as serious.
Speaking to CP24 outside TPS headquarters on Monday, Det. Const. Shannon Whitehead urged anyone who knows anything about this shooting to come forward.
“We do believe that there were multiple people at the arena at the time of the incident and we are looking for anyone to come forward that witnessed the incident, anyone with footage, video footage, or any description of the suspect to come forward,” she said. “Any little bit of information will assist in the investigation.”
Whitehead said so far the suspect is only described as a male in his mid 20s. He was last seen wearing all dark clothing and a mask, she said.
Investigators are also still working to determine what may have led to the shooting, which police have not described as targeted at this point. Multiple shell casings were found at the scene.
It’s also not clear exactly what was happening inside La Liga when the shooting occurred. According to the complex’s website, the venue hosts indoor soccer games as well as salsa, Zumba, birthday parties, and other activities.
The Homicide and Missing Persons Unit is handling the investigation.
Anyone with further information should contact Toronto police at 416-808-7400, or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-8477 (TIPS) or www.222tips.com.
