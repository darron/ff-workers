The Quebec City mosque shooting (French: Attentat de la grande mosquée de Québec) was an attack by a single gunman on the evening of January 29, 2017, at the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City, a mosque in the Sainte-Foy neighbourhood of Quebec City, Canada. Six worshippers were killed and five others seriously injured after evening prayers when the gunman entered the prayer hall shortly before 8:00 pm and opened fire for about two minutes with a 9mm Glock pistol.[1] Approximately 40 people were reported present at the time of the shooting.
The perpetrator, 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder.[2] On February 8, 2019, Bissonnette was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 40 years.[3][4] Upon appeal, the Court of Appeal of Quebec found 40 years without parole to be unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment, adjusting the sentence to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 25 years.[5] Quebec prosecutors sought to reinstate the original sentence with an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.[6] The decision was upheld on May 27, 2022,[7] meaning Bissonnette will be eligible for parole in 2042.[8]
The shooting prompted widespread discussion of Islamophobia, racism, and right-wing terrorism in Canada.[1] Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Philippe Couillard called the shooting a terrorist attack,[9][10] but Bissonnette was not charged or sentenced under the terrorism provision of the Criminal Code or described as such by terrorism experts.[11][12] On the fourth anniversary of the attack, the Trudeau government announced plans to commemorate the day of the attack as The National Day of Remembrance of the Quebec Mosque Attack and of Action Against Islamophobia.[13]
Background[edit]
The province of Quebec prioritizes immigrants who speak fluent French, and therefore has many Muslim immigrants from former French colonies such as Senegal, as well as Syria, Lebanon, and the North African countries of the Maghreb. A number of Muslim French citizens with family origins in the former French colonies have immigrated to Quebec from France. Arab residents of the province make up a larger share of its population than in any other Canadian province. Like most immigrants to Quebec, they are concentrated in Montreal, Quebec&#39;s largest city.[14]
Muslims and other religious minorities in Quebec have been at the centre of debate about religious dress. The Bouchard-Taylor Commission on Reasonable Accommodation (2007–2008) was the first to recommend restrictions on religious dress. Subsequent governments have sought to place restrictions on religious items of clothing such as Muslim head scarves and Jewish skull caps through legislation such as the Charter of Quebec Values.[1]
Quebec City has a Muslim population of about 10,000.[1] It has a low crime rate — in 2015, there were only two homicides in the city [15] – but saw a threefold increase in the number of reported hate crimes against Muslims in 2017.[1] It also has an active far-right community, compared to other Canadian cities. A local chapter of Soldiers of Odin said it wanted to conduct safety patrols of neighbourhoods where Muslims live.[16]
A competitive media market of local right-wing radio talkshow hosts features regular attacks on Islam and Muslims as being incompatible with the values of Quebec society.[17]
The Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City&#39;s Grande Mosquée de Québec in the city&#39;s west-end Sainte-Foy neighbourhood is one of several mosques in Quebec City.[18][19] The mosque is close to the Université Laval, which has many international students from French-speaking, Muslim-majority African countries.[15] In June 2016, during Ramadan,[20] it was the target of an incident in which a pig&#39;s severed head was left outside the mosque.[15] The incident has been described as a hate crime and an Islamophobic attack.[20][21] There had been at least seven prior incidents at the mosque.[22] Because of the incidents, the mosque had installed eight CCTV security cameras.[15] Two weeks before the shooting, the mosque had finalized plans to install a fortified main entrance and a back escape exit for Ramadan in June.[22]
Shooting[edit]
The shooting took place at the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City in the Ste-Foy suburb of Quebec City between 7:54 and 7:56 p.m EST on Sunday 29 January 2017 after nightly evening prayers. The shooter, 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, killed six people and injured five while firing five 10-round magazines from a 9 mm Glock semi-automatic pistol.[3][23] The perpetrator fled the scene and gave himself up to police later that evening, and would plead guilty as charged to six counts of first degree murder and six counts of attempted murder with a restricted firearm on January 30, 2017. Detailed facts of the attack using witness testimony and six security camera recordings were made public in April 2018 by the prosecution during the perpetrator&#39;s sentencing hearing and put to rest conspiracy theories that a second shooter was involved. Superior Court judge François Huot prohibited publication of the video footage, but allowed the press to publish descriptions.[24] Details were summarized in the sentence handed down on February 8, 2019.[3]
Context[edit]
In the month before the shooting, Bissonnette was on leave from his job at Héma-Québec with an anxiety disorder following an altercation with a coworker. In this month he obsessively visited the Twitter accounts of several right wing media personalities including Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, David Duke, Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich, Richard B. Spencer and Kellyanne Conway. Bissonnette checked in on the Twitter account of Ben Shapiro 93 times in the month leading up to the shooting.[25] He was also on vacation from his university program of study in political science. He was due to go back to work the day after the shooting. During his time off, he would regularly visit Islamophobic websites and search the Web for information on mass shooters. On the day of the shooting, he had breakfast while reading web content dealing with jihadi attacks, mass murder, and suicide. Through the afternoon, he became drunk by consuming sake as he read about mass shooters. When he learned from television that the Canadian government would begin to welcome refugee claimants fearing Trump administration immigration policies and arriving at the U.S. border, he decided to proceed with the long-planned shooting.[3][26] At 4:14 PM, the shooter visited the Facebook page of the Quebec City Mosque. At 5:28 p.m., he went to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#39;s Twitter account and read the tweet welcoming those seeking refuge in Canada.[27] He went to his parents&#39; house for dinner, and went to his bedroom to look at more websites on mass shootings and suicide.[3]
At 7:00 p.m., Bissonnette turned off his computer and left his parents&#39; home armed with a concealed 9mm semi-automatic Glock pistol in his pocket and a Czech semi-automatic .223 caliber rifle  that he had packed into a guitar case.  He told his parents he was going to run errands and practise shooting at a gun club he frequented weekly. He drove his parents&#39; Mitsubishi directly to the mosque.[24][3] At 7:37 p.m., he hesitated to follow through with the shooting and drove to a nearby convenience store to buy and quickly drink a Vodka Ice.[24][28]
He then returned to the mosque. Believing he had been seen in possession of firearms and that he would eventually be caught, he decided to go through with the shooting.[3]
Prayers at the mosque started at 7:30 p.m. and ran for about 15 minutes. About half the attendees then left; 46 people remained for individual prayers and socializing in the large prayer hall. It was a cold, snowy evening at −22 Celsius, and no one lingered outside the building.[24]
Attack on mosque[edit]
Just before 7:54 p.m, Bissonnette walked up the snow-covered driveway to the front of the mosque, opened the case carrying the rifle, and loaded it. Two brothers, Mamadou Barry, age 42, and Ibrahima Barry, age 39, put on their coats in the lobby of the mosque as others in the main room socialized or prayed privately. Just after 7:54, they left the building. The gunman pointed his rifle at them and pulled the trigger, but the gun jammed. Frightened, the brothers backed against the front door, slipped on the ice, and fell.[29]  The shooter dropped the rifle, feigned a smile to indicate it was a joke, and took out the handgun from under his coat. The Barry brothers quickly got up to flee, but Bissonnette opened fire, hitting Ibrahima in the left arm, back, and abdomen, causing him to collapse. He then approached the fallen victim, shooting him in the head. Mamadou Barry, hit in the shoulder and thigh, attempted to flee before collapsing several feet away. Bissonnette then shot him in the head.[3]
Two other worshippers at the doorway saw the gunman approach and fled down the lobby corridor to the main prayer room. Panic then ensued in the prayer room.[3][29] The shooter entered the mosque, firing all ten bullets in his Glock pistol. He used the ensuing chaos to retreat into the lobby and reload. Several men rushed into the mihrab to hide, while others escaped through emergency exits. One man managed to grab a child and hide her behind a column.[3]
At 7:55 p.m., Bissonnette re-entered the prayer room. He would fire 30 rounds in 30 seconds during the second spree and would particularly target people attempting to take cover near the mihrab and the imam&#39;s office. He calmly shot at people hiding in the mihrab, killing Khaled Belkacemi, a 60-year-old University of Laval professor.[24][3] Abdelkrim Hassane, age 41, was killed near the imam&#39;s office. Aymen Derbali, crouched near the shooter, attempted to distract the shooter from more crowded areas of the mosque by lurching towards him, but was shot in the knee and chin.[30] As Derbali slumped and crawled on the floor, Bissonette shot him 6 more times, but Derbali would survive.[31] Bissonnette then targeted 44-year-old  Aboubaker Thabti, murdering him at point blank range with three bullets to the skull. About 20 seconds into the second round of the attack, 57-year-old Azzeddine Soufiane, a local grocer and butcher, rushed Bissonnette,[32] propelling the shooter into a shoe rack against the wall.[29][32] Bissonnette managed to push Soufiane back far enough to free his hand and shoot him twice.[3] The gunman then shot Nizar Gali in the back and shot Said Akjour in the left shoulder as he hid in the mihrab.[33]
Bissonnette retreated into the lobby a second time, reloading his weapon and returning to the prayer room in four seconds. Finding Soufiane still moving, the assailant put a final bullet in his head.[3] The attacker then moved to the middle of the prayer room to get a better angle,[24]  but most people who crowded in the mihrab were well protected.[29]
At 7:56, the shooter finally exited the main entrance and fled the scene in his father&#39;s car, leaving his semi-automatic rifle and guitar case behind. He kept one bullet in his pistol to end his life in the Charlevoix woods north of the city. Police would recover a total of 4 magazines and 48 9-mm casings from the attacker&#39;s Glock pistol at the scene. Police would find 28 rounds still in the rifle, with one jammed bullet, and would recover 48 9 mm casings from Bissonnette&#39;s Glock inside the mosque.[3][23]
Seconds later, Mohamed Belkadhir, a University of Laval engineering student who had left the meeting to shovel snow, arrived at the mosque entrance and called 911 when he found the Barry brothers.[34] He checked inside the mosque, then returned to tend the first two victims, removing his coat to cover Mamadou, who still showed signs of life. When police arrived with their weapons drawn, Belkadhir fled, believing the killer had returned. He was caught and arrested as a suspect and held overnight, but was released the next morning.[29] Reports of the arrest led to rumors and online conspiracy theories about a second shooter.[24] Police released an affidavit in March 2017 to confirm details of this arrest.[35]
Victims[edit]
Six people were killed, and five were seriously injured in the attack. An additional 35 witnesses were inside the mosque.[1][36] Initial reports also said between eight and 19 others were treated for minor injuries.[37][38][39]
The six murder victims were Ibrahima Barry (aged 39, Quebec government IT worker), Mamadou Tanou Barry (aged 42, accounting technician), Khaled Belkacemi (aged 60, professor at Laval University), Aboubaker Thabti (aged 44, pharmacy technician), Abdelkrim Hassane (aged 41, Quebec government computer analyst) and Azzedine Soufiane (aged 57, grocery store owner).[1][40][41][42] Two were Guineans, two Algerians, one Moroccan and one Tunisian, all dual citizens of Canada.[43][44] Eyewitness and video surveillance indicate that Soufiane was fatally shot after rushing and grappling with the shooter, saving several lives.  Many mourners described him as a hero.[45] Soufiane was posthumously awarded the Star of Courage.[46]
Perpetrator[edit]
Alexandre BissonnetteBorn (1989-12-01) December 1, 1989 (age 33)NationalityCanadianEducationUniversité LavalCriminal statusIncarceratedMotiveIslamophobia, xenophobia[47]Date apprehendedJanuary 29, 2017 (2017-01-29)
Alexandre Bissonnette (born December 1, 1989), a student at Université Laval and former Canadian Army Cadet,[48] was identified as the suspect. He called police from the area near the Île d&#39;Orléans Bridge, and told them he was involved and wanted to surrender.[49][50][51] Université Laval announced that Bissonnette would not be allowed on campus while judicial proceedings were underway.[52]
Bissonnette grew up in Cap-Rouge. Neighbours said his father and mother were both present in his life and were model parents, adding that they had never had a problem with either him or his twin brother Mathieu.[52] Former acquaintances say he was introverted and sometimes bullied at school.[53] He was not known to police, and he had no court records other than traffic violations.[53] Before the shooting he had been living in an apartment near the mosque along with his twin brother.[54][55]
People who knew him said he had far-right, white nationalist, and anti-Muslim views.[50][56][57] The manager of a refugee-support Facebook page said Bissonnette frequently denigrated refugees and feminists online.[52][53] A member of the mosque said he had met and talked with him outside the mosque on January 26, believing he was interested in Islam, but he veered away from the subject.[58][59]
Bissonnette checked in on the Twitter account of Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief of the conservative news site the Daily Wire, 93 times in the month leading up to the shooting.[60] Bissonnette was also a supporter of Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen.[61][62] Despite his support for right-wing politicians, he also praised separatist Parti Québécois and promoted the party&#39;s nationalist policies.[63][64]
He later confessed to police that he was motivated by the 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa, where a Canadian soldier guarding the National War Memorial was killed. Bissonnette was taking Paxil at the time of the attack.[65]
Prosecution[edit]
Main article: R v Bissonnette
Criminal trial[edit]
Bissonnette was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder on January 30.[49] Although the Canadian prime minister and Quebec premier both condemned Bissonnette&#39;s actions as a terrorist attack, charges of terrorism were not brought; according to Canadian legal experts, in the Canadian Criminal Code, the offence of terrorism requires not only acts of violence, but usually also collaboration with a terrorist group, which would be difficult to prove for a single gunman.[66][67] Bissonnette was included in 2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada in the context of Right-Wing Extremism.[68] The six counts of murder would amount to a maximum possible sentence of 150 years without parole under the 2011 Ending Sentence Discounts for Multiple Murders Act (Criminal Code section 745.51).[66] Evidence against the suspect was provided to the defence team on February 21. The defence team&#39;s request for a publication ban on future proceedings was also granted.[69][70]
Bissonnette told police officers he was motivated by Justin Trudeau&#39;s response to Donald Trump&#39;s travel ban, and that he was convinced that refugees were a threat to his family.[47] After initially pleading not guilty to all charges on March 24, 2018,[71] Bissonnette pleaded guilty to all charges on March 28, 2018.[72] On February 8, 2019, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment with no parole for at least 40 years.[73] On March 8, 2019, it was reported Bissonnette would appeal the sentence.[74]
Appeals Court[edit]
On November 26, 2020, the verdict on Bissonnette&#39;s appeal was delivered. A 3-panel judge of the Quebec Court of Appeal unanimously struck down section 745.51 of the Criminal Code. They found that it violated section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. Accordingly, Bissonnette&#39;s parole ineligibility was reduced from 40 to 25 years.[75][76]
Supreme Court of Canada[edit]
On January 30, 2021, the prosecution applied for leave to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada.[6] The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court&#39;s ruling that consecutive life sentences are unconstitutional. [77]
Aftermath[edit]
Police response and arrest[edit]
Police created a dragnet and closed the bridge to the Île d&#39;Orléans while searching for suspects. One individual was initially detained at the mosque by police. Bissonnette surrendered near the Île d&#39;Orléans after he contacted 9-1-1 at 8:10 pm,[78][79] proclaimed himself as the shooter involved and gave them his location.[18][80] According to one early report, a man who presented himself as a witness said two attackers dressed in black and with Québécois accents entered the mosque and shouted &#34;Allahu Akbar&#34; before shooting.[80][81]
Police later determined that there was only one gunman[80][81][82] and said only one of the detained individuals was considered a suspect. The other individual was released shortly afterwards, and is considered a witness.[79][83] He later said he was outside the mosque when he heard the shooting and went inside when it ceased. He added that he mistook the arrival of the armed police as the shooter returning and fled after which he was arrested.[36][79] According to an affidavit released to the media in March, he was administering first aid to the victims when he was arrested.[35] It also said a chase of a possible suspect ensued after a police officer pulled a gun and ordered him to freeze. The man was later arrested.[84]
Police began treating the attack as a terrorist incident at 10:00 pm, and activated the Structure de gestion policière contre le terrorisme (SGPCT) (Structure of police management against terrorism) protocol, a protocol for acts of terrorism in the region. It gave control of the investigation to the provincial Integrated National Security Enforcement Team—a joint anti-terrorism task force comprising the Montreal police, the Sûreté du Québec, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.[19][15][85] At 10:40 pm, police declared the situation under control, with the building secured and the occupants evacuated.[80]
Treatment of the wounded[edit]
The injured were transported to different hospitals in Quebec City,[15] such as the Hôpital de l&#39;Enfant-Jésus and the Centre hospitalier de l&#39;Université Laval.[86]
Future security measures[edit]
Philippe Pichet, the chief of Montreal police, and Maxime Pedneaud-Jobin, the mayor of Gatineau, both announced their cities would increase security around local mosques.[87] Martin Coiteux, the provincial public security minister, said religious buildings in the province would be protectively surveilled, those in the capital by the Quebec City police.[80]
Vigils and commemorations[edit]
A vigil in Montreal&#39;s Park Extension.
On January 30, public vigils and gatherings were held across Canada to show sympathy to the victims of the shooting, their families and their community.[88] The largest assembly, held in Quebec City, was attended by the prime minister and his wife, and leaders of all official federal parties.[89] After speeches, a procession walked in silence to the site of the attack and left flowers before the mosque.[90] The government of Quebec also set up a register of condolences where citizens can send testimonies to the victims of the attack and the families of the dead.[91]
Impact on first responders[edit]
The shooting had secondary casualties that only manifested after the event. Andréanne Leblanc, 31, was found dead in March 2018, dressed in her paramedic&#39;s uniform. She was on duty that January night when she received the urgent call to head to the mosque in the city&#39;s Sainte-Foy district.[92] She is regarded by the citizens of Québec City and her peers as the seventh victim of the shooting. Her suicide has highlighted the lack of mental health resources for first responders. They are often mentally injured with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or the same symptoms, sometimes years after similar or repeated traumatic interventions. Leblanc&#39;s case is regarded as a catalyst that brought Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and Minister of Health Ginette Petitpas Taylor to release in April 2019 Supporting Canada&#39;s Public Safety Personnel: An Action Plan on Post Traumatic Stress Injuries. The announcement brought with it $29 million in new funding.[93]
Christchurch mosque shootings[edit]
Further information: Christchurch mosque shootings
The suspect in the Christchurch mosque shootings, Brenton Tarrant,  covered the weapons used in the attacks with various white-supremacist and anti-Muslim symbols and references.[94] He also wrote the names of various people, including Alexandre Bissonnette&#39;s.[95]
Government reactions[edit]
Quebec City Mayor Régis Labeaume declared that the city would stand with the victims&#39; families through what he called a &#34;terrible ordeal that defies reason&#34;.[87] Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard offered solidarity with the families and friends of the victims, and tweeted, &#34;Quebec categorically rejects this barbaric violence.&#34;[80] He also denounced the attack as terrorism and ordered that flags at the National Assembly of Quebec be flown at half-mast.[80] Labeaume and Couillard, along with Martin Coiteux, the provincial Minister of Public Safety, held a joint press conference and called for unity.[96] At the conference, Couillard told Quebec&#39;s Muslim population &#34;We&#39;re with you. You are home, you are welcome in your home. We&#39;re all Québécois.&#34;[19]
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also extended his condolences to the victims and denounced the shooting as a &#34;cowardly attack&#34; and as a &#34;terrorist attack on Muslims in a centre of worship and refuge&#34;.[9][20][80][87] In a Senate hearing, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson called the suspect a &#34;criminal extremist&#34; and warned about the type of terrorism arising from easily influenced people being radicalized because of growing political polarization and &#34;caustic&#34; political debate.[97][98]
Various world leaders expressed their condolences over the attack. Pope Francis, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and U.S. President Donald Trump contacted Prime Minister Trudeau and offered him assistance.[99][100]
On the anniversary of the attack, January 29, 2018, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke before the House and said that the victims were &#34;gunned down by ignorance and hatred, fuelled by Islamophobia and racism&#34;, and further stated: &#34;These attacks sought to divide this country and its citizens, drive wedges between neighbours, and make enemies of strangers&#34;.[101] Andrew Scheer also stated the &#34;shooting was an act of terror&#34;, and that: &#34;Last year&#39;s attack was a hate crime that took six innocent lives.&#34;[102]
Legacy[edit]
The Mosque: A Community&#39;s Struggle, a documentary film by Ariel Nasr about the shooting and its aftermath, premiered in 2020.[103]

And all of those involved in the inquiry hope to close the gaps they uncovered — and prevent a similar tragedy from happening to another military family.The Nova Scotia fatality inquiry will hear lawyers&#39; recommendations to the judge on April 19Laura Fraser  · CBC News  · Posted: Mar 28, 2022 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: March 28, 2022The fatality inquiry into the murder-suicides of Lionel, Shanna, Aaliyah and Brenda Desmond heard evidence over 53 days about the ways in which different government institutions failed the family.  (Dave Irish/CBC)Though Lionel Desmond finished his tour of Afghanistan in August 2007, the trauma of the war would rage inside him — and inside his home — for the next decade.It culminated on Jan. 3, 2017, when he fatally shot his wife, his mother and his daughter before taking his own life.A Nova Scotia fatality inquiry has spent the last two years examining what led up to that evening. All of those involved in the hearings hope to close the gaps they uncovered — and prevent a similar tragedy from happening to another military family.There are many such families in this country.Roughly 400 soldiers are medically released from the Canadian Forces each year due to mental illness, and upwards of 70 per cent of them have partners and children, according to federal figures.The evidence heard over 53 days may help those families by answering the questions guiding the inquiry:  Did Lionel Desmond have access to appropriate mental health care?  Did his wife, Shanna, his daughter, Aaliyah, and his mother, Brenda, have access to appropriate domestic violence intervention?  Did the many health-care professionals and police officers who saw the family have the necessary training and information to spot the risk of intimate partner violence?  Should a man with profound and complex PTSD symptoms, recently released from an in-patient psychiatric program, have been able to legally purchase a firearm? The short answer is no. But the nuances present an overarching question the lawyers will answer in their final submissions to Judge Warren Zimmer on April 19: What must be changed?  Shanna, 31, and Aaliyah, 10, could have used more support as Lionel transitioned from the military, evidence suggests. (Facebook)Happy-go-lucky to a soldier &#39;destroyed&#39;By all accounts, Desmond was known as a helpful, happy-go-lucky young man.That side of him shone through in military training and before his tour of Afghanistan in early 2007, his friend and fellow soldier, Cpl. Orlando Trotter told the inquiry. Desmond wanted to be a good partner and father.But the seven-month tour was &#34;like going to hell,&#34; Trotter testified in February 2021. Desmond&#39;s job there involved navigating landmines in order to retrieve bodies, creating memories that would repeat in his mind for years.&#34;You take somebody like him and put him in a war zone and [say], &#39;Take this rifle, and that guy over there, shoot him.&#39; I would say it destroyed him,&#34; Trotter testified. &#34;You have to have a certain type of personality to go into battle, and he just wasn&#39;t one of those guys.&#34; Cpl. Orlando Trotter served alongside Lionel Desmond in Afghanistan in 2007. (Nova Scotia Courts)What they saw overseas destroyed the lives of many serving with 2nd Battalion Royal Canadian Regiment at the time. Desmond&#39;s battalion arrived at a point of high Canadian casualties. It replaced a regiment in the months following Operation Medusa, a deadly offensive that saw 12 Canadian soldiers killed.  Their own battalion would lose 10 people when a vehicle drove over an improvised explosive device, Trotter told the inquiry, and many within the battalion of 300 to 400 soldiers — himself among them — have since been diagnosed with PTSD.Desmond is one of eight from that battalion to have died by suicide since returning home, according to Trotter&#39;s evidence.His death is the only known murder-suicide of the group.Lionel was part of the India Company, 2nd battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment in Afghanistan in 2007.   (Facebook/The Canadian Press)A diagnosis of complex PTSDA military psychiatrist diagnosed Desmond with complex PTSD and major depression in 2011, after his symptoms reached a point where he struggled to perform his duties and were a source of conflict in his marriage.He experienced flashbacks and nightmares about the bodies he&#39;d retrieved, and he often felt numb and struggled to connect with his family and friends, his military psychiatrist Dr. Vinod Joshi told the inquiry.  &#34;His long-term prognosis is guarded in light of poor response to treatment.&#34;- Dr. Vinod Joshi, military psychiatristDespite medication, group therapy and individual psychotherapy, Desmond never made a full recovery.When he experienced stress in his life, he would relapse.One of those sources of stress was his marriage, which had been affected by his PTSD and a separation, as Shanna was in Antigonish, N.S., studying for her nursing degree while he was still posted to CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick.&#34;His long-term prognosis is guarded in light of poor response to treatment,&#34; Joshi wrote in a psychological progress report in October 2012. Desmond had his exit interview from the military in May 2015; he had been medically released.Difficult transition to civilian lifeDesmond was referred to the Occupational Stress Injury Clinic in New Brunswick, a program funded by Veterans Affairs, but he missed appointments as he began spending more time with family in Nova Scotia. He was struggling.Part of that struggle is one that evidence suggests is common among new veterans — finding a new identity outside of an institution that has provided the structure of their adult lives.It&#39;s something that can be compounded by financial trouble. In Desmond&#39;s case, he was awaiting disability compensation and a military pension to kick in. Even when that happened, he still used the food bank at times.One of the people meant to help him with this transition was a case manager with Veterans Affairs Canada, but Desmond&#39;s first contact with a case manager was six months after his release.   Lionel Desmond is shown here in this family photo, with his mother, Brenda, left, and daughter, Aaliyah. (Submitted by Cassandra Desmond)That delay is an issue the inquiry has limited powers to change, given that the inquiry is provincial in scope. But the federal departments involved, including Veterans Affairs, have had representatives at the proceedings and have pledged their support.The department also launched an internal review after the murder-suicides, and a spokesperson told CBC News in June 2021 that it was actively recruiting for more case managers. In May 2016, Desmond was sent to Ste. Anne&#39;s Hospital near Montreal to try to stabilize his ongoing PTSD symptoms, including his struggle to manage his emotions. At that point, he had disclosed to medical practitioners that he was having nightmares about his wife cheating on him — and that, in those dreams, he would kill her in retaliation. When he left the hospital in August, his case conference report said he&#39;d made &#34;minimal progress.&#34;Falling through the cracksWhile he was in treatment, his home sold in Oromocto, N.B. That prompted his decision to move back to Nova Scotia immediately following his release from hospital and live with Shanna and Aaliyah, who were living with his in-laws in Guysborough County, N.S. This period — the five months after Desmond&#39;s release — is one that the inquiry returned to repeatedly and one that will certainly be an area that the recommendations will try to address. Veteran who killed his family, himself sought help from 6 doctors before triple-murder suicideN.S. firearms officers told to expand background checks under Bill C-71, Desmond inquiry hearsBecause, as Zimmer said, Desmond &#34;fell through the cracks.&#34; He went from the intense structure of an in-patient program to receiving no therapeutic treatment for the final months of his life. Part of the reason for this is because he&#39;d been seeing a team in New Brunswick and it took months for Veterans Affairs to arrange for his care in Nova Scotia. But it&#39;s also because layers of bureaucracy prevented him from getting his medical files from his time in the military and as a veteran at Ste. Anne&#39;s. Dr. Matthew Bowes, the province&#39;s chief medical examiner, noted that he himself could not get access to Desmond&#39;s military medical records, despite later testimony that there is a procedure allowing their request.But if that procedure didn&#39;t work for someone with the education and authority of a provincial medical examiner, we can&#39;t rely on it to work for someone in a vulnerable position, Bowes said.If it doesn&#39;t work in practice, it doesn&#39;t work at all.Dr. Matthew Bowes, Nova Scotia&#39;s chief medical examiner, testified that he felt systemic failures contributed to the deaths of the Desmond family. It&#39;s why he compelled the government to call an inquiry. (Brett Ruskin/CBC)That medical information, when combined, highlighted not only the extent of Desmond&#39;s illness, but also a pattern of risk to his family.It included reports of nightmares, shouting, police visits, firearms being removed from the home and requests for him to leave the family home for a night to cool off. If the six doctors who saw Desmond between August 2016 and Jan. 2, 2017 had access to that history, they might have seen that risk and made different decisions, a domestic violence expert told the inquiry. More than 1,600 men have called seeking help since a hotline quietly launched in N.S.As the Desmond inquiry hears from its last witness, the judge hints at changes to comeInstead, on Jan. 2, 2017, Desmond was released from St. Martha&#39;s Hospital emergency room where he&#39;d spent the night after his wife had asked him to leave. The next day, he bought a semi-automatic rifle using a firearms licence that was twice reinstated after two different doctors cleared him for mental fitness at different points in the previous five years. He then drove to his in-laws&#39; house, slashed the tires on his wife&#39;s car and walked inside the home. Six gunshots later and four people would be dead: Shanna, 31, Aaliyah, 10, Brenda, 52, and Lionel, 33.A collage shows the Desmond family and Lionel&#39;s military comrades. (CBC)Preventing this from happening againThere is vast room for improvement in how government institutions treat veterans, people with mental illness and families at risk of domestic violence. In Desmond&#39;s case, the transition from the military health-care system to the civilian one created numerous hurdles. It&#39;s an area that the judge and lawyers Tara Miller and Adam Rodgers say they expect to address. All three have noted that there needs to be better communication between the military and civilian health-care systems — and an easier way for a soldier to access their military health records.&#34;When somebody is released, either medically or they&#39;re retiring from the military, they should walk out of the door that day with their medical records on a disc or a USB stick,&#34; said Miller, a lawyer representing the estates of Brenda and Aaliyah Desmond. &#34;The fact that there is a process that they have to apply and wait and submit forms to get their medical records, the bureaucracy and the administration slows all that down.&#34;WATCH | Lawyer Tara Miller shares her recommendations for change: Lawyer at Desmond inquiry says changes are needed for veterans leaving military health-care system1 year agoDuration 5:32Tara Miller, a lawyer at the Desmond inquiry, says soldiers leaving the military should be given a copy of their health records the day they are released. To do so, will make sure civilian doctors have a better picture of what treatment the patient might need.Rodgers, who represents Lionel Desmond&#39;s estate, said he expects he&#39;ll make a recommendation to take that idea a step further: to connect veterans with a family doctor as soon as they leave the military.&#34;This inquiry is not designed to lay blame, so we&#39;re not focusing too much on who did what improperly, but it&#39;s clear that there were major gaps in the transition from the military to the provincial health system,&#34; he said in an interview. Gun safetyAnother gap the judge returned to this week will also certainly be part of his final recommendations — making it mandatory for doctors to report a change in a patient&#39;s mental health if they&#39;ve previously cleared them to be fit enough for a firearms licence.Doctors in New Brunswick twice signed off on Desmond&#39;s medical form needed as part of a firearms licence review. That form has already changed so that it requires more information from a doctor than a simple yes or no — and the form in Nova Scotia is also more robust.But Zimmer noted that there are laws that force doctors to take away someone&#39;s driver&#39;s licence if they become a public safety risk. The same could be true for firearms, he suggested. Inquiry counsel Allen Murray echoed the judge&#39;s sentiment. &#34;A medical practitioner provides an opinion that is … it&#39;s a snapshot in time,&#34; he said in an interview. &#34;And, of course, the person&#39;s physical or mental health can change.&#34;Lionel is shown here with his daughter, Aaliyah, in Toronto. By all accounts, he deeply loved the girl. (Submitted by Cassandra Desmond)Support for familiesThe presumption of preventability in the deaths of the Desmond family is outlined, too, in the risk factors that are considered to predict a heightened risk of domestic homicide. The Ontario Domestic Violence Death Review Committee has identified 41 such factors and considers there to be a heightened risk if seven are present. In the Desmonds&#39; relationship, there were 20. &#34;If somebody had done a thorough risk assessment&#34; with either partner in the last month of their lives, they should have seen that pattern, testified Peter Jaffe, director of the Ontario-based Centre for Research and Education on Violence Against Women &amp; Children.Framed photos of Shanna and 10-year-old Aaliyah Desmond are displayed in the Borden home, where they were killed on Jan. 3, 2017. Thelma and Ricky Borden, Shanna&#39;s parents, still live there. (Eric Woolliscroft/CBC)That&#39;s a gap that Miller hopes to close. She plans to recommend ways to make it easier for family members to share information with health-care providers.&#34;What can we do to enhance, to strengthen, to make robust domestic violence interventions … and to support the families along that journey,&#34; she said.&#34;Lionel Desmond brought ... the battle home with him. And that meant that those people at home with him entered that war unwittingly with him as they struggled to support him and move forward.&#34;MORE TOP STORIESFirst 3 officers on scene of N.S. mass shooting set to testify at inquiryCanadian Coast Guard &#39;monitoring&#39; parts failures in new vesselsFirst PersonI was a 23-year-old nurse when I had a stroke.

After five months and several more calls without a response, Mathieu Murgatroyd, a clinical psychologist who was treating Mr. Desmond at the Operational Stress Clinic in Fredericton, called VAC on his behalf. Dr. Murgatroyd told a coroner’s inquest earlier this year that he had been concerned that Mr. Desmond was becoming unstable and needed co-ordinated support. A case manager made a call to Mr. Desmond the next day, but it took a month for them to actually connect.On Jan. 3, 2017, the former corporal shot and killed his young daughter, wife, mother and himself in the small rural community of Upper Big Tracadie in rural Nova Scotia.In the years since the triple murder-suicide, VAC had not made anything public about its handling of Mr. Desmond’s case owing to privacy legislation. But a coroner’s inquest in Nova Scotia has shone a light on cutbacks and bureaucratic hurdles within VAC that led to systemic failure in the treatment of the Afghan war vet.Among the bureaucratic obstacles were privacy concerns that prevented VAC from sharing detailed information about Mr. Desmond’s medical history among a contracted private therapist and health care providers in provincial systems; a shortage of case managers owing to cutbacks in the department; and delays transferring his file when he moved to a Montreal in-patient facility and then back to Nova Scotia.The inquest will reconvene on Sept. 13, and closing arguments are expected later this month. Provincial Court Justice Warren Zimmer, who is presiding over the inquiry, will produce a report and recommendations. However, they will only be provincial in scope because Ottawa rejected the Desmond family’s request for a joint provincial-federal public inquiry.The 42 days of testimony that the inquest has already heard have provided a window into the lives of thousands of soldiers whose mental health was impaired by their combat experiences in Afghanistan. They have also shown significant gaps in how the federal and provincial governments help veterans with PTSD. With the Taliban’s resurgence in Afghanistan, some vets are facing renewed struggles.“It is inexcusable that we do not have a system that supports our veterans when they come home from combat, when they have legacy injuries from serving our country and they do not have the resources and support to help them in a way that’s meaningful,” said Tara Miller, counsel for Mr. Desmond’s sister Chantel Desmond, and the estate of his mother, Brenda Desmond. She is also joint council to present concerns related to Mr. Desmond’s daughter, 10-year-old Aaliyah Desmond.In addition to revealing administrative barriers at VAC, the inquiry has also shown a need for ways to share medical records that respect veterans’ privacy and provide enough information to give treatment providers a full account of their patient so that more soldiers don’t fall through the cracks like Mr. Desmond did, Ms. Miller added.In the coming weeks, Ms. Miller said, counsel will formulate closing arguments centred on identifying pragmatic solutions for the systemic issues that came out of the testimony.More than 40,000 members of the Canadian Armed Forces served in Afghanistan during the NATO-led mission, Canada’s largest deployment since the Second World War. Of those, 22,134 are clients of VAC, and 9,600 are receiving disability benefits for a mental health condition directly attributable to their service in Afghanistan.A year and a half after Mr. Desmond was medically released from the military, in the late afternoon of Jan. 3, 2017, he bought a rifle and a box of bullets from a hunting store in Antigonish. He changed into camouflage clothing as if he were going into battle. His wife had recently told him she wanted a divorce.He parked his Ford Escape with its veteran licence plate up a remote logging road in the woods, about a kilometre behind the family home of his wife, Shanna Desmond. He slashed the tires of her red Dodge pickup truck parked in the driveway, then went in the back door and shot and killed Shanna, a newly graduated nurse. He shot his mother and daughter – likely unintended victims who happened to be there, RCMP Corporal Gerard Rose-Berthiaume said at the inquest. Then he turned the gun on himself.Without adequate support after Mr. Desmond left the military, it was like he brought the war home to his family, Ms. Miller said. “That’s exactly what happened here with Shanna and Aaliyah and Brenda. They were the unintended victims of this battle that came home on home soil. They got caught in the crossfire,” Ms. Miller said.Justice Zimmer ordered an internal review into VAC’s treatment of Mr. Desmond to be entered as evidence at the coroner’s inquest after lawyers for the Attorney-General of Canada said it wasn’t relevant and refused to provide it. The review found that Veterans Affairs made no procedural errors, but it cited 18 “opportunities for improvement,” many of which Josh Bueckert, a spokesperson for the federal agency, told The Globe and Mail VAC has been working on. Hiring more case managers was one of them, he said.VAC has more than doubled the number of case managers since 2015 to provide more timely access, and implemented a new screening tool in 2019 to triage high-risk veterans, spokesperson Emily Gauthier said in an e-mail. The case manager ratio is now 31.8 veterans per case manager, compared to VAC’s target of 25:1.“VAC is working to lower the case-manager ratio,” Ms. Gauthier said. “We continue to recruit case managers.”In the months before the deaths, Mr. Desmond also faced another delay from VAC as his mental health continued to deteriorate and he became increasingly controlling of his wife.After attending a VAC in-patient clinic in Montreal in the summer of 2016, Mr. Desmond returned to rural Nova Scotia. His caregivers in Montreal and his case manager had decided he needed a VAC clinical case manager to increase the amount of help he was getting to meet his basic needs and navigate everyday life in his rural community. But Mr. Desmond had to wait three months for his clinical case manager to complete training on administrative software. In that time, he also went two months without mental-health treatment.In VAC’s review of Mr. Desmond’s death, the department found that training for clinical case managers should be “done on an urgent basis for cases that require immediate support.”Other “opportunities for improvement” VAC identified in its internal review include more timely transfer of files to case managers after a veteran relocates. Mr. Bueckert said a new, clearly defined file-transfer process has been in effect since June.The coroner’s inquest also heard that a psychologist and occupational therapist at the VAC-funded in-patient clinic in Montreal had recommended that Mr. Desmond receive a neuropsychological evaluation when he returned to Nova Scotia to determine his cognitive capacities and identify the support he needed. However, his case manager, Marie-Paule Doucette, told the inquest she wanted to get Mr. Desmond set up with the clinical case manager first, and had not known that would take three months.VAC’s internal review recommends that files of veterans who have case managers be reviewed regularly to ensure medical recommendations are taken into consideration.Mr. Bueckert said quarterly quality assurance reviews are now taking place.Because VAC did not share detailed information about Mr. Desmond’s medical history with health care providers, including about his increasingly fraught relationship with his wife, none of the people trying to help him in the days and weeks before he killed his family members and himself knew the extent of his mental health issues.Roland Lawless, a veterans’ advocate who is president of the Veterans Memorial Medical Centre Society, a non-profit that plans to provide mobile outreach services to veterans in rural areas, says privacy protection laws need to be relaxed when lives are at stake.“It’s a tragedy that should never have happened,” Mr. Lawless said. “A big bungle of privacy kept everybody out of the loop until the big bomb went off.”Special to The Globe and MailOur Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

On Thursday, a jury found Edward James Penner guilty of 1st degree murder in the 2017 shooting death of Adam Cormack in Whitehorse. (Claudiane Samson/Radio-Canada)Edward James Penner of B.C. has been sentenced to life in prison with no parole for 25 years, after being found guilty of first-degree murder in the death of Adam Cormack, 25, in Whitehorse two years ago.A 12-person jury delivered the verdict in Yukon Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon, after a day of deliberations. Justice Scott Brooker delivered the sentence.Penner was charged in July 2017, a few days after Cormack&#39;s body was found on a dirt road near a gravel pit north of Whitehorse. Cormack had been fatally shot once, above his right ear.The Crown spent more than two weeks laying out its case. Prosecutor Tom Lemon summarized that case Tuesday, urging jurors that the evidence &#34;points in only one direction&#34; — that Penner planned to kill Cormack &#34;execution style&#34; and shot Cormack in the head with an AR-15 rifle.Lemon said Penner and Cormack were both involved in the drug trade, and that Penner came to Whitehorse to investigate a missing handgun.Yukon jury hears closing arguments in Edward James Penner murder trialThere were cheers and sobs in the courtroom on Thursday as the jury foreman delivered the verdict.Cormack&#39;s mother, Theresa Cormack, then delivered a victim impact statement on behalf of the family. She thanked the jury, and then addressed Penner directly.&#34;I f--king hate you,&#34; she told her son&#39;s killer. &#34;I hope you rot in hell.... Karma is a bitch, and she&#39;s coming for you.&#34; Cormack described her own difficulties since her son&#39;s death, saying she&#39;s been on medication and seeing a psychiatrist. She says she hasn&#39;t worked for two years, and has to look around when she leaves the house to go to the store.She said her whole family has been affected, and asks Penner if he knows what it feels like.&#34;Every day is a struggle and not getting easier,&#34; she said.Cormack&#39;s sister Catherine also addressed Penner, and called him a &#34;sick, sick individual&#34; with no conscience. She said her brother always &#34;had my back.&#34;&#34;You, Penner, took that away from me,&#34; she said.Some &#39;damning&#39; evidence, lawyer saysPenner declined any comment before the court.Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom after the sentence was delivered, defence lawyer André Ouellette said the trial unfolded quicker than he expected.Defence lawyer André Ouellette could not say whether Penner might appeal the verdict. (Chris Windeyer/CBC)&#34;There was substantial evidence, some of it was damning, some of it, in my view at least, was very ambiguous. But the jury heard it and they made [up] their minds,&#34; he said.Ouellette would not speculate whether the verdict might be appealed.&#34;It&#39;s up to Mr. Penner of course, to decide.&#34;Penner has 30 days to launch an appeal. CBC&#39;s Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Yukon jury hears closing arguments in Edward James Penner murder trial B.C. man charged with 1st-degree murder in recent Whitehorse homicideFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

A Britsh Columbia man has been found guilty of first-degree murder for the 2017 slaying of 25-year-old Adam Cormack in Ibex Valley.
Edward James Penner, a 22-year-old from Quesnel, B.C, showed no emotion when a Whitehorse jury delivered its verdict the afternoon of Sept. 19 following roughly a day and a half of deliberations.
He also declined the chance to speak before Yukon Supreme Court deputy Justice Scott Brooker handed down the automatic sentence for first-degree murder ⁠— life in prison, with no chance of parole for 25 years.
Penner’s trial began in late August, with the jury spending just over two weeks listening to evidence painting a grim picture of how Penner and Cormack had ended up near a gravel pit off Kilometre 1450 of the Alaska Highway, about 20 minutes from Whitehorse.
There, the two men had walked up a dirt trail, where Penner, in a planned and deliberate manner, shot Cormack once in the head, killing him instantly, the jury was told.
The murder was apparently prompted by a stolen or missing gun; Cormack’s body was discovered on June 28, 2017.
Members of Cormack’s family packed into the courtroom for the verdict, many of them crying and holding on to each other for support as the jury entered the room.
One woman screamed, “Yes!” and burst into loud tears as soon as the jury foreperson said the word “guilty.”
Cormack’s mother and sister, Theresa and Catherine Cormack, respectively, gave emotional victim impact statements shortly after.
“I want to say how much I hate you,” Theresa said. “You are a P.O.S. … You are a coward. I hope you rot in hell.”
Theresa described Cormack as “a loving, tender soul” and “a great person and a good boy” despite his run-ins with the law. Her life had become “a lot harder without my baby boy” as he had been the man in the house, she said, and she now feels like a “prisoner” in her own town, fearful of leaving her home.
The murder devastated her “close-knit family,” Theresa continued, and the family pets still wait for Cormack to come home, with the dog he picked out still sleeping in his bed.
“I just still wait for my boy to come through the front door and yell ‘Hey Momma, what’s up?’” she said. “Do you know how hard it is to say goodbye to my baby boy without getting to see him? No kiss on the cheek, no kiss on the forehead… Do you know how hard it is to explain to a little one what happened to Uncle Adam, and why he went to heaven?”
Cormack’s sister was reprimanded by the judge before she gave her statement because, as she walked to the podium, she had approached Penner and spoke directly to him, pointing and telling him he was “going away.”
“Edward James Penner, Tanner, whatever your freaking name is… You ruined my life on June 28, 2017… You took my baby bro away from me,” Catherine said through heavy sobbing.
Cormack was “one of the kindest people,” she said, and was her “partner in crime,” her “little big bro” who always had her back.
“You, Penner, took that all away from me for the rest of my life … He should be here,” she said, describing Penner as a “sick, sick individual.”
“Look at everything you’ve done, everything you said you didn’t do… You obviously have no (conscience), you murderer.
“You have ruined my life forever… Roses are red, violets are black, I want my baby brother back.”
Penner did not show any reaction to the victim impact statements.
“Bye-bye!” someone yelled from the gallery as he was escorted out of the courtroom.
In an interview outside the courthouse, Penner’s lawyer, Andre Ouellette, said he thought the trial “went as well as can be expected, with very serious matters like this.”
“The reaction’s always the same — the jury’s never wrong. Ordinary people hear the evidence … When the jury’s pronounced its verdict, justice is done,” he said.
Neither Ouellette or his co-counsel, Kelly Labine, had had a chance to speak with Penner post-verdict.
“I think Mr. Penner heard the evidence the same way we all did,” he said, when asked about his client’s reaction. “It was a serious case. There was substantial evidence, some of it was damning, some of it, in my view at least, was very ambiguous, but the jury heard it and they’ve made their minds… We conducted our case the very best we could. I’m satisfied we conducted it well.”
Whether there will be an appeal, Ouellette said, is up to Penner.
Crown attorneys Amy Porteous and Tom Lemon declined to comment on the outcome, other than Lemon saying, “We worked very hard, I can tell you that.”
