A Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) employee is believed to have killed a Prince Rupert woman before fatally shooting himself Monday morning.
Police were called to the inside of Ocean Centre Mall at 8:30 a.m. for a &#34;serious police incident.&#34;
Const. Gabriel Gravel with Prince Rupert RCMP says the suspect is believed to have shot the woman, a Ministry of Children and Family Development worker, before attempting to take his own life. The two were known to each other.
Family and friends have identified Patty Forman, 52, as the woman killed at the scene and call her &#34;an amazing soul.&#34;
“What a tragedy. Rest in peace, my dear cousin,&#34; wrote a family member on a Facebook tribute post.
The 44-year-old male suspect, who has not been publicly identified, died later in the hospital from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The CBSA has confirmed with Glacier Media that he was a CBSA employee.
&#34;The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is aware of the incident that took place at the Ocean Centre Mall in Prince Rupert, B.C., and the involvement of a CBSA employee,” says Rebecca Purdy, a senior spokesperson for CBSA. &#34;We extend our deepest sympathies to the victim’s family during this difficult time.”
Purdy says the CBSA will not be providing further comment at this time due to the active RCMP investigation.
The Office of the Premier confirmed, after a request made by Glacier Media, that Forman was an employee of the Ministry of Children and Family Development’s regional office.
“This was a violent act committed against someone who worked to serve local children and families. This is traumatic news that no family expects to receive, and it’s a tragic event for the tight-knit community of Prince Rupert,” states a joint release from the province, noting their thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim.
“Our hearts also go out to those who acted immediately to provide emergency care, those who may have witnessed this violence and anyone whose safety was threatened by yesterday’s events. We are here for you, and we will be in the days, weeks and months to come.”
Prince Rupert Mayor Herb Pond said the shooting was &#34;truly tragic&#34; and that supports are available for anyone in the small community who may need them.
Pond said his office, located near the scene, was locked down for about 90 minutes, with people being told not to leave. The mall contains several offices, including a Service Canada location.
&#34;When you get the word that this is a truly tragic incident, it&#39;s overwhelming. A lot of our staff know at least some of the individuals involved. There&#39;s some overlap. So we&#39;re offering counselling to our people,&#34; he said.
Pond encouraged residents who felt affected by the incident to seek out resources.
&#34;So make sure you reach out and get the help you need. (There&#39;s) nothing wrong with getting help,&#34; he said.
RCMP Staff Sgt. Dave Uppal said police knew the shooting would be traumatic for the community and set up supports for those who may need help.
Residents are asked to call Prince Rupert Victim Services at 250-627-7779 or VictimLinkBC at 1-800-563-0808.
Eryn Collins, a spokeswoman with the Northern Health Authority, said their Prince Rupert health unit is in the mall, but the incident did not take place in the facility.
She said the offices have been closed until further notice and clients who have appointments have been informed.
The MP for Skeena-Bulkley Valley, Taylor Bachrach, said he was &#34;shocked and saddened&#34; by the news.
&#34;My thoughts are with the loved ones of those harmed, local first responders and all those affected,&#34; he said on Twitter.
In an update Tuesday afternoon, police said they&#39;ve wrapped up collecting evidence and the mall &#34;has been released back to management.&#34;

Six people are dead, including the alleged 73-year-old suspected shooter, in a shocking Sunday evening shooting in Vaughan.
York Regional Police (YRP) responded to an active shooter incident at a condo building at 9325 Jane Street around 7:20 p.m. on Sunday night following reports of a male shooter, since identified as Francesco Villi.
YRP issued a statement acknowledging that &#34;an interaction occurred between the officers and a male subject and the subject was shot. He was pronounced deceased at the scene.&#34;
The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has invoked its mandate in response to the shooting.
Five victims and one suspect deceased, one victim in hospital, following an active shooter incident at a condo on Jane St., Vaughan. Police Investigation is ongoing. https://t.co/3gO6v5zjyZ https://t.co/ooq0Bi6eDV
— York Regional Police (@YRP) December 19, 2022
&#34;We offer our sincere condolences to the victims and their families,&#34; said YRP Chief Jim MacSween from the scene, stating that the situation no longer presents any &#34;further threat to public safety.&#34;
While police have remained tight-lipped about the active and ongoing investigation, information emerging suggests that Villi was suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease and had made multiple pleas to his condo board to rectify building issues regarding dust and other irritants.

It is also alleged that the victims of the shooting were members of the condo board managing Villi&#39;s building.
Its reported the Vaughan shooting were 6 members of Board of Directors for YRCC 1139 which is the governing body of 9325 Jane Street (Jane/Rutherford Condos). Online the condo corporation is described as “corrupt” and the management as incompetent.

Villi posted a video to his Facebook page shortly before the shootings, angrily calling out his condo board and telling followers, &#34;That&#39;s all I want, comfort in my home.&#34;
&#34;You bastards, all of you. You indecent bastards and criminals.&#34;

Five people were killed when a gunman stormed into a condo board meeting in Toronto, Canada on Sunday and opened fire, cops said.Police were called to a residential building in Vaughan, Ontario, at about 7.20pm on Sunday to reports of an active male shooter who had shot several victims at a condo in Vaughan, Ontario.
Suspect Shot Dead by Police

The gunman was shot and killed by police at the condo after going on his murderous rampage, according to Chief James MacSween of York regional police.&#34;When police arrived, an interaction occurred between the officers and a male subject and the subject was shot. He was pronounced deceased at the scene,&#34; MacSween said in a statement released late on Sunday.&#34;Horrendous scene,&#34; MacSween said. &#34;Six deceased. One of them is the subject. The other five are victims.&#34; In addition to the five dead, one other person was struck by gunfire and was recovering at a hospital on Sunday night.Who is Francesco Villi?Ontario&#39;s special investigations unit, which becomes involved when there is a death or serious injury involving police, is now investigating the shooting.The gunman&#39;s identity was not released late Sunday and a motive for the violence was not yet known. However, social media users are claiming the shooter is an individual named Francesco Villi, who posted several videos about &#34;injustice&#34; and &#34;torture&#34; from board members of the residential building where the shooting took place. Villi appears to be a resident of the building.In one of the videos posted on Facebook, Villi accuses some of the board members of manipulating the judges and the court system against him. &#34;I did not have to do this,&#34; Villi says as he claims he&#39;s being denied comfort in his own home for seven years.According to reports, Villi was involved in a legal dispute with board members of the condo, Belleria Residences, over the poor air quality in his unit. He was scheduled for a hearing with the condo board committee today.In other videos on his Facebook profile, Villi complains about having a dripping nose due to the bad air quality in his apartment.Mass shootings are rare in Canada and Toronto has long prided itself as being one of the safest big cities in the world. In 2020, shortly after a gunman shot and killed 13 people in Portapique, Nova Scotia, Canada banned more than 1,500 models of &#34;assault-style&#34; firearms and components, and set limits on how destructive bullets could be.Read more Who is Chicago High School Shooter?

And the board, in turn, had been seeking judicial orders to stop him from hurling insults and writing defamatory Facebook posts about residents, security guards and board members.On Monday morning, an Ontario Superior Court judge in Newmarket stayed the scheduled hearing involving Mr. Villi after learning he had died. Lawyers for the condo board had been preparing to tell the court that the resident of Suite 104 at 9235 Jane Street in Vaughan needed to be evicted or even imprisoned to curb his years-long campaign of harassment.Authorities told reporters on Monday that Mr. Villi had used a semi-automatic handgun in the shootings, but did not describe its model, how he got it or if it was legally registered.As for the fact that three of the dead were on the condo board, “Obviously that will be investigated thoroughly,” York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween said. A sixth victim is in hospital.Police have not released the names of any of the dead or injured, but on Monday condo board president John Di Nino issued a statement after it was reported that his 66-year-old wife was the victim who survived the mass shooting. “This is obviously a very difficult time for my family, and I would ask that our privacy be respected,” he said.Police on Monday (Dec. 19) confirmed three of the five people killed in a shooting at a Toronto-area highrise were members of the condo board. Authorities have identified the suspected gunman as a 73-year-old building resident who used a semi-automatic handgun on his victims before being shot dead by police.The Canadian PressResidents of the Jane Street building described acts of targeted violence.“From my understanding he went through the building knocking on doors,” Anthony Cutrone, one of the condo’s other board members, said in an interview.He added that he had heard the shooter may have been trying to hunt down past and present board members. “I feel guilty to be alive,” he said.Building resident John Santoro said he opened the door of his unit Sunday night to see a pair of police officers armed with rifles by the elevators.“I did hear a commotion in the corridor,” he said, adding that police were going floor to floor as they responded to the shootings.Mr. Santoro said the building was soon surrounded by police and emergency vehicles.“I saw body bags coming out, being loaded into ambulances,” he said.Open this photo in gallery:John Santoro, a resident of a Vaughan, Ont., condominium building where a fatal shooting took place, speaks to reporters on Dec. 19.Arlyn McAdorey/The Canadian PressMr. Villi was not known to residents of the building as being violent prior to the shootings. Police appear to have been called to deal with him, but only rarely. Residents say that he would swear at neighbours and film them. Court documents say multiple property managers quit because of his harassing behaviour, and that security guards asked for reduced hours so they would not have to deal with him.Such complaints date back at least to 2018. Court filings show that Mr. Villi was convinced that the condo board was conspiring against him, possibly even targeting him with electromagnetic waves emanating from an electrical room below his unit. (In Ontario, condominium buildings are corporations run by volunteer board members who hire professional property managers to oversee the day-to-day operations.)Last week and on the weekend, Mr. Villi last posted several videos on Facebook, in which he spoke out about alleged problems in the building and described his enemies as demons. In a video he posted the night before the shootings, he denounced the “chest-tightening vibrations” and electromagnetic pulses coming though his floor.Another video shows a speakerphone conversation from November, in which Mr. Villi calls a lawyer acting for the condo board. During the conversation, he pleads with the lawyer not to take him to court.Though Mr. Villi spoke with an Italian accent, he was a long-time resident of Canada. In the 1970s, records show, he started a Barrie-based construction contracting company. He closed it in 2017, three years after he bought his condo unit in Vaughan, a fast-growing city north of Toronto.The condo corporation began to consider him a major problem more than four years ago. In 2018, it sought a court order forbidding him from harassing the building’s staff and members of the board, in person and through social media.Court documents say condo board officials at times tried to avoid him. A board vice-president “timed her exits and entrances to the building when she thinks he will not be there because he has been harassing and threatening her.”Following litigation in 2019, Justice Paul Perell issued a formal judicial order against Mr. Villi. “This court orders that Francesco Villi shall not make any video or audio recording of the Corporation’s Board members, management, residents or employees” it says.The order is still in effect. It told Mr. Villi that he could communicate with the condo corporation only in writing. But records show that in September, 2021, he was found in contempt of court for violating the directive. He was told to pay costs of $29,500.Despite the penalty, the pattern of behaviour continued. This past June, a condo resident filed a security report saying Mr. Villi had “started calling me a demon and the devil.” The condo corporation started collecting evidence of other breaches, and wrote Mr. Villi several letters telling him he was violating a court order.Court records also show that in July a resident of the seventh floor asked a security guard to call police. She alleged Mr. Villi had been calling women who were sitting outside of the building “bitches.”“The police spoke to the resident,” says a report the condo corporation filed in court. “We have not heard further from the police since that time.”In August, the condo board applied for a new court hearing. Lawyers argued in documents that the contempt citation had failed to stop the harassment. They sought a new court order finding Mr. Villi “in contempt of court for breaching the Order of Justice Perell dated October 24, 2019 and directing [him] to pay a fine or be imprisoned.”Mr. Di Nino, the condo board president, wrote an affidavit supporting the bid for stronger measures.“Nothing has worked,” he wrote. “I do not know what else can be done to protect us against Mr. Villi. We need the court’s help in getting Mr. Villi to stop his campaign of abuse and harassment. We need some peace. We need this matter to be dealt with through courts rather than in our building.”The new court hearing was scheduled for September, but it was adjourned. The presiding judge, Justice Mary Vallee, wrote at the time that Mr. Villi was having difficulty following the proceedings.“I explained to him that this hearing was not about his complaints with the electrical room or other mechanical equipment, his health or any steps that he believed the defendant should have taken to address his concerns. I explained that the only issue before me was whether the plaintiff had breached Perell J.’s order dated October 24, 2019.” (Mr. Villi is the plaintiff in the lawsuit because he initiated it.)She added: “Nevertheless, almost all of the plaintiff submissions were focused on his complaints and the manner in which he believes the defendant has treated him. Despite my efforts to refocus him on the relevant issues, he continued in this manner.”It was this case that was scheduled to be back in court on Dec. 19 – the day after the shootings.Mr. Cutrone, the condo board member, said the board had hosted its annual Christmas party earlier this month.
