Ross Sheppard High School or École Ross Sheppard (SHEP or Ross Shep) is a high school located in a northwest neighbourhood of Coronation Park, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The school colours are Colombia blue and navy blue, and it is represented by a Thunderbird, also known as a T-Bird logo. Outside the school is a totem pole with a T-Bird on top, which has been given by British Columbia&#39;s Indigenous elders, representing the school mascot. The school serves the needs of over 2,000 students attending grades 10-12, including approximately 35 international students annually. Ross Sheppard School&#39;s philosophy is based on four pillars - Academics, Arts, Athletics and Service.
Academics[edit]
Ross Sheppard School offers the standard academic program as well as International Baccalaureate (IB), Physical Education, Careers and Technology, Fine Arts, and practical arts. Languages offered other than English include Chinese Mandarin (as part of the ECBEA program), Spanish and all levels in French.
Ross Sheppard offers the International Baccalaureate (I.B.) Diploma Program in addition to the Alberta education curriculum. During this year continue in a partial I.B. program, or continue in the regular Alberta education program. Most students take the regular Alberta education program while few students take the full program. Students complete the I.B. program while fulfilling their Alberta diploma requirements. Ross Sheppard also offers French Immersion with the first class graduating in 2008 with a bilingual diploma.
Partnering with Edmonton Public Schools and Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, Ross Sheppard provides the &#34;Foundations of Health Sciences&#34; course. The course allows students to receive hands-on skills in the health care field and to look to a future career in acute and long-term care or other fields with strong communication and interpersonal skills. Students can choose to pursue a career in health care immediately, or to study related post-secondary programs. Students enrolled in level 2 of the Skills Centre programs are eligible for enrollment to NAIT through the Skill Centre Project.
According to Fraser Institute, Ross Sheppard is rated as one of the top 10 best high schools out of all 25 public high schools in Edmonton, Alberta, and ninety-ninth out of two hundred sixty-two high schools in Alberta.[1]

Resource centres[edit]
Three resource centres are located throughout the school, are easily accessible and offer students support with their academic studies.
In its main floor library is the Shep Connection Centre, where students take a number of individualized courses (online and correspondence). The school also has a special section on the main floor library with a number of mandarin resources from the Confucius Institute in Edmonton.
On the upper floor, there is another Learning Commons, known as &#34;the Bookloft.&#34; This new venue hosts a technology resource centre, including laptops, SMART Board and a Videoconferencing suite. The school has online access to both the University of Alberta and Edmonton Public Library Catalogues.
Student Services is a place for students to come for assistance in aspects of High School (career counselling, personal counselling, post-secondary transition). A number of students, faculty and staff also assist international students in adapting to their new environment and making the transition into Canadian culture. Student Services is the hub for scholarship information. Over a half million dollars in scholarships are earned by Shep students each year.[citation needed]
The school&#39;s namesake[edit]
Ross Sheppard represented Canada in the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, and competed in the hop, step and jump.[2]
Sheppard went on to become a teacher, principal and school administrator, and served as superintendent of the Edmonton Public School Board from 1940 to 1955. Sheppard devised the composite high school system[citation needed], offering academic, commercial, and industrial subjects, and was the first superintendent in Canada to implement the concept. During his 15 years as Superintendent of Schools, the number of permanent public schools increased from 30 to 63.
When he retired in 1955, the school board named its newest high school in his honour. Construction started in 1956,[3] with an addition in 1958.  Sheppard’s retirement  concluded 42 years of service to the Edmonton public school system. He died 12 years later, on September 4, 1967.

Incidents[edit]
On March 16, 1959, 19-year-old Stan Williamson opened fire with a .22 calibre rifle inside a crowded corridor of Ross Sheppard High School, killing 16-year-old Howard Gates and wounding five teenage girls. The shooting ended when three 18-year-old students held the gunman down until he could be arrested by police.[11]
On July 9, 2009, summer school classes were interrupted after a suspected arson broke out. Firefighters managed to contain the flames to a boy&#39;s washroom that afternoon, but the soot damage covered three floors of the northwest wing of Ross Sheppard. A quarter-million dollars worth of repair work was finished in time before classes resumed in September.[citation needed]
On September 19, 2011, students at Ross Sheppard high school were sent home early Monday morning after carbon monoxide was detected to be at potentially dangerous levels. Fire alarms at the school were triggered around 8 a.m. after staff reported the smell of exhaust. The school was evacuated, with students sent to neighboring Westmount Mall, later being told to go home for the day. No injuries were reported.[12]
In May 2012 physics teacher Lynden Dorval became the object of local newspapers such as the Edmonton Sun,[13] the Edmonton Journal[14] and the National Post,[15] when they learned he was brought before a school board hearing for giving students scores of zero if they did not hand in assignments, which went against the school&#39;s no-zero policy. On May 18, 2012 he reportedly received a letter informing him he had been suspended indefinitely. Dorval feels that not giving zeros went against his principles as an educator, whereas the school feels that zeros on assignments that were not handed in do not accurately measure learning or performance but are more a comment on a student&#39;s behaviour.[16] In August 2014, a provincial review board ruled that Dorval &#34;was treated unfairly in his dismissal&#34; and ordered full repayment of salary from the day of his dismissal and a top-up of his pension. The Edmonton Public School Board were given 30 days to file an appeal to the review board.[17]

Robert Raymond Cook (July 15, 1937 – November 15, 1960) was a Canadian mass murderer who was convicted of killing his father, Raymond Cook, in Stettler, Alberta, on June 25, 1959. It is alleged that Robert massacred his entire family at their home in Stettler, but was only charged with killing his father. He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.
After officials declined to grant clemency, Robert was hanged in 1960. He was the last person to be executed by the province of Alberta.[1]
Early life[edit]
Robert&#39;s mother died when he was 9 years old. He first got into trouble when he was 10, for stealing a car. When Robert was 12, his father married his elementary teacher, Daisy Mae Gaspar. The family moved from Hanna to Stettler.[2]
Robert first went to jail when he was 14 years old. From the time of his first incarceration to his execution, Robert spent a total of less than a year outside of prison.[2]
Murders, trial, and execution[edit]
Months before the murders, Robert was hit in the head with a lead pipe while serving time for breaking and entering and car theft. After this incident, he was noted as becoming more quick-tempered.[3]
On June 28, 1959, police discovered Raymond Cook, 53, his wife, 37-year-old Daisy Cook, and their five children: Gerald, 9, Patrick William, 8, Christopher Fred, 7, Kathy, 5, and Linda Mae, 3, dead.[4] The adults had been shot with a double-barrelled shotgun. The children had been bludgeoned to death with the rifle butt. The bodies were found in the grease pit of their garage in Stettler, Alberta. The victims were in their nightwear and blood was found on the mattresses, indicating that the massacre happened as the family was sleeping. The massacre had been committed three days earlier.[5]
Robert had been arrested in Stettler the day before and charged with obtaining goods under false pretences, after he had traded the family&#39;s 1958 Chevrolet station wagon for a 1959 Impala convertible. Inside the trunk, the police found birth certificates, insurance policies, Raymond Cook&#39;s marriage certificate, and the report cards of the children. Robert also had a suitcase with four sets of children&#39;s pyjamas, new bed sheets, and a photo album with pictures of his mother. When the officers asked Robert where his parents were, he repeatedly changed his story. At one point, he claimed his father gave him $4100, and that the family had moved to British Columbia. However, the best friend of Raymond Cook said he knew nothing about this plan.[6]
Robert was accused of committing the massacre. Although he was implicated in the deaths of his entire family, he was only charged with the murder of his father in order to speed up the legal proceedings.
Just after midnight on July 11, 1959, Robert escaped from the Ponoka Mental Institution he was detained in, for a psychiatric assessment, after he had been denied permission to attend the funerals of his family. Robert&#39;s escape sparked one of the biggest manhunts in Alberta history. Officials had 100 members of the RCMP, police dogs, 50 soldiers from the local militia, and aircraft search for Robert. Several days later, he was found hiding in a pig farm near Bashaw, Alberta.[7]
In December 1959, Robert was found guilty of murder and received a mandatory death sentence. He won a retrial on appeal, but was found guilty of murder once more in June 1960. The jury did not make a recommendation of mercy either time. The prosecutor, John Wallace Anderson, said Robert was one of the quickest thinking defendants he&#39;d ever met.[8]&#34;He was sharp as a fox. He scared the hell out of me a couple of times with his mental acuity. He was cross-examining us while were cross-examining him, to give himself time to formulate his answers. I was the hare rather than the hound.&#34;
&#34;My associate and I had to write out questions for Bobby and throw them in a hat so we could pull them out at random in the courtroom, and break the continuity of questioning to keep him from anticipating what was coming next.&#34;Robert maintained his innocence up until his execution.[9] While on death row at the Fort Saskatchewan Provincial Gaol, Robert authored a poem as part of a last-minute plea for clemency sent to the Solicitor General of Canada, and Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker.[10]
I sit here in my death cell, I know not why,
For the evidence proved me innocent, and that is no lie
Seven members of my family, murdered to date,
The jury on a guess would make it number eight,
Was it planned that way or was it just fate.
My lawyers family threatened with the same,
What reason can there be for such a dirty game,
The judge directed, pay no heed and reject that lead,
Pay no heed to another one, pay no heed to the shirt and gun,
Close your eyes, you need not see,
Two places at once I could not be,
So I ask you is it strange that I am sentenced to the noose.
While my family&#39;s killer is on the loose.
He wiped up his finger prints, all traces of his crime,
Putting a stained suit under the mattress, no doubt he knew it was mine
His purpose clear to see the murder of the missing member without fear of the fine
Time he would gain and safe he would be
So I ask you is it strange that I am sentenced to the noose
While my family&#39;s killer is on the loose.
My family&#39;s funeral I wanted to attend,
I had to escape and sealed my own fate in the end.
If my loved ones saw, and wondered why I was not there,
I pray God told them of the hounds and the hare.
They hounded me by day, they hounded me by night
Blood hounds and helicopters, oh, what a sight.
Out to murder, armed and dangerous they said,
That is so funny, I&#39;ll laugh till I am dead.
So I ask you is it strange that I am sentenced to the noose.
While my family&#39;s killer is on the loose.
I&#39;ve heard of justice, but where can it be,
I looked in the dictionary, behold! there it is to see.
When I sent for my lawyer he just shook his head.
Justice will only come long after you&#39;re dead.
So you people of the world take note,
It&#39;s murder when the innocent die, at the end of a rope.
After officials declined to grant a reprieve, Robert was hanged at the Fort Saskatchewan Provincial Gaol just after midnight on November 15, 1960. He was pronounced dead at 12:19 AM. The case has been the subject of several books and two plays.[11][12]
