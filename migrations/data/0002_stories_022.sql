2-Minute Overview
On April 14, 2014, 22-year old Matthew de Grood went on a stabbing spree the left five young people dead at a house party in the upscale neighbourhood of Brentwood in Calgary, Alberta. It was the largest mass murder in Calgary’s history.
All five victims were described as “good kids” – young and talented and completely innocent.
Zackariah Rathwell and Josh Hunter were friends and bandmates who had released a new album at a sold-out gig just two nights before they were murdered.
Kaitlin Perras was a gifted ballet dancer, beautiful and vibrant.
Lawrence Hong, originally from the Philippines, was an urban studies student and—like his alleged killer—a committed volunteer.
Jordan Segura was pursuing a degree in religious studies and a career, ironically enough, in the funeral business.
After his arrest, Matthew de Grood was held at a secure psychiatric facility adjacent to the Calgary Remand Centre.
De Grood, son of respected veteran Calgary Police Service Inspector Douglas de Grood, underwent a psychiatric review to determine if he was fit to stand trial.
Two days after news broke that their son was the worst mass murderer in Calgary’s history, Douglas and Susan de Grood faced the news cameras and Douglas spoke to the families of the young people his son murdered. (Read Douglas de Grood’s complete statement at the end of this document.)
“We hope someday we will have answers as to why this happened. Regardless, it won’t bring the victims back, but we would give anything to do just that.”
On May 22, 2015, that review found de Grood was competent because he understood the charges against him and was able to communicate rationally with his lawyer.
His trial was set to begin on May 29, 2016, but on May 25th de Grood was found not criminally responsible for the murders by reason of mental disorder.

Killer Granted Unsupervised Community Outings
Dr. Santoch Rai told the Alberta Review Board that Matthew de Grood’s risk of re-offending was low, but that if he did commit another crime, it would be “high severity.”
Rai said de Grood knows that he needs to take his medication and suggested de Grood should be allowed unsupervised trips to supervised places in Edmonton, as well as be eased into living in a group home.
On October 1, 2019, the Alberta Review Board released their September 17th decision to grant Matthew de Grood unsupervised release into the community, despite the significant threat he still poses to public safety.
Gregg Perras, father of murder victim Kaitlin Perras, was disgusted at the news.
“At each review, we are always unpleasantly surprised by the latest ‘improvements’ in his mental state and the subsequent ‘privileges’ he will receive,” he wrote in an email to Global News.
“It seems ridiculous that someone who killed five people could be enjoying time outside the hospital only with a ‘responsible’ adult after only three years of being determined (not criminally responsible).”
Barclay Hunter, father of murder victim Josh Hunter, said the news is hard to fathom.
“It’s hard for the average person to wrap their head around. Why this is acceptable and why this would happen … I think he needs to be treated fairly and humanely and treated for his illness. But you know our goal is to see that people that cross that threshold in severe cases like this are not ever considered for absolute discharge.”
On October 3, 2019, Alberta Solicitor General Doug Schweitzer posted the following message on Twitter.
“I’ve heard from many Albertans who are frustrated &amp; disturbed by this decision.
“I’ll be formally requesting that Alberta’s Review Board ensure a maximum possible role for victims to be part of the hearing process &amp; advocating that Ottawa conduct a review of standards of release.
“I’ve also instructed my department to examine any &amp; all other options around the review board process to respect victims.
“My thoughts are continually with the families &amp; friends of Joshua Hunter, Kaitlin Perras, Jordan Segura, Lawrence Hong, and Zackariah Rathwell.”

Son of God? The Illuminati? Vampires and Werewolves?
Two psychiatrists said Matthew de Grood experienced psychotic delusions during the timespan when he stabbed five young university students to death. They said he believed a war to end the world was about to begin.
“This war would’ve included fighting with werewolves and vampires,” Dr. Alberto Choy said. “He believed Zackariah was about to attack him and Zackariah … was a werewolf at the time. He believed those other individuals were also … supposed to attack him.”
Dr. Lenka Zedkova testified Matthew de Grood believed an end-of-the-world war was being waged, and he needed to stop it.
“He started believing that they were going to kill him because he was the son of God,” Dr. Zedkova said.
“Mr. de Grood also told me at some point he heard a male demonic voice, which he attributed to the sun god, telling him ‘kill them all before they kill you,’ and to him it marked the beginning of the war.”
“He believed that all these individuals were the Illuminati and they were about to kill him, and they were possessed by the moon god.”
Dr. Zedkova said, in her opinion, de Grood likely suffered from schizophrenia when he attacked his victims and was therefore not in touch with reality. While suffering from a mental disorder like as schizophrenia, de Grood would not be able to perceive things correctly.
Dr. Andrew Haag disagreed with his two colleagues, but only to a degree. See R. v. de Grood, 2016 ABQB 294.
“Mr. De Grood certainly did know and could foresee the physical consequences of his actions. He clearly knew that people would be seriously harmed by his actions and indicated that he tried to kill his victims quickly and humanely. However, it is Dr. Haag’s opinion that Mr. De Grood did not know that his actions were morally wrong at the time. He indicated to Dr. Haag that he had to kill his victims and saw his actions as a ‘kill or be killed situation.’ In his mind, Mr. de Grood was acting in self-defence at the time.”

Joint Statement of Families as Trial Gets Underway
On March 16, 2016, the families of the slain young people issued a joint statement.
We speak to you collectively as one voice, as a group of family members who have lost our wonderful children and siblings far too soon.
We are giving a written statement at this time and are not planning to field any questions today. We will likely provide a statement at the end of the trial and may be available for questions at that time.
We are here to represent the voices of the victims…our loved ones who had their futures taken away and cannot represent themselves…and we are also here to support one another in our profound loss.
Please understand that the last two years have been extremely difficult … incredibly long and anxiety ridden for us as parents, as family members, and for our children’s friends, who also lost so much that terrible night.
It is immeasurable to comprehend the anguish and sorrow we have experienced over the last two years. Only those who have experienced significant loss can relate.
All five families are so thankful and so grateful for the overwhelming support that we have received from our extended families, from friends and from the greater Calgary community. We will continue to need that love and support now and in the future.
The grieving and the memories never end for any of us. There is no such thing as a “new normal” that some people talk about. There is only existing… surviving… and a series of bittersweet events going forward in our families lives such as graduations, weddings, and grandchildren. These milestones will be happy and sad at the same time.
A series of tributes to our children will be presented in court and on TV over the next several days to reflect their short, but meaningful lives and put the focus where it should be… on the family that was taken from us: Lawrence, Josh, Kaiti, Zack and Jordan. (The accused always gets too much focus when a trial occurs.)
We are well aware of the important role that the media plays on a daily basis in informing the public of the truths and details about a trial. However, please respect our wishes for privacy during this incredibly stressful time. We will come to you if we wish to comment.
The priority for us during this trial is to ensure that our loved ones will be given the fair and just attention that they deserve. All we ask is that you remember how they lived – full of purpose, full of life, full of goodness and love for their friends and families. Their deaths and this tragedy do not define them.
Thank you for your time and attention. We have nothing more to add at this time.

Not Criminally Responsible, Justice Macklin Rules
On May 25, 2016, Justice Eric F. Macklin ruled Matthew de Grood was not criminally responsible for the murders.
It has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that, in the early morning of April 15, 2014, Matthew Douglas de Grood caused the deaths of five young people: Joshua Barclay Hunter, Zackariah James Rathwell, Kaitlan Ashley Perras, Jordan Gabriel Segura and Lawrence Martin Hong.
I find on a balance of probabilities that at the time he caused their deaths, Matthew de Grood was suffering from a mental disorder that rendered him incapable of appreciating or knowing that his actions were wrong.
Therefore, and in accordance with s. 672.34 of the Criminal Code, I find that Matthew Douglas de Grood committed the acts that resulted in the deaths of these five individuals but he is not criminally responsible for those deaths on account of mental disorder.

Statement From Families After Not Criminally Responsible Decision
On May, 25, 2016, the families of the murdered university students issued a joint statement.
Now that the trial for Matthew de Grood has concluded, the families of Jordan Segura, Zackariah Rathwell, Kaiti Perras, Joshua Hunter and Lawrence Hong would like to make a short statement.
First of all, we would like to express our immense gratitude to Justice Macklin for allowing the five tributes to our wonderful loved ones within the court. Our goal at the beginning of the trial was that the spotlight be put on those we lost; that continues to be our goal now and into the future.
We ask that everyone remember the names:
Zackariah Rathwell
Jordan Segura
Kaiti Perras
Lawrence Hong
Josh Hunter
We can all cherish their legacy by reminiscing moments together, living out their values and supporting others through the scholarships and foundations created in their memory.
Those are the individuals who should be remembered. Those are the lives that were lost, and no matter what: Kaiti, Jordan, Josh, Zack and Lawrence are still gone and our families will never be whole again.
The end of this trial is not the end of this journey for us, we continue to be broken.
The finding of NCR (not criminally responsible) will be a recurring nightmare for our families.
In this system Matthew de Grood will meet with a Mental Health Review Board every year to determine if he will be granted concessions.
There will be no peace for us; our wounds never fully heal because every year our families will have to wonder, what will be the fate of the man who damaged so many lives.
Every year we will be forced to relive details of our family’s deaths, the anguish and sorrow.
We ask that fellow Canadians become informed about the justice system, the designation “Not Criminally Responsible” and its implications.
A possible reprieve for our families is the designation of a High Risk NCR, a new law that among other changes would allow a review board to decide to assess an extremely dangerous offender every three years.
The five families would support the prosecution in seeking the designation of High Risk NCR, which would give gravitas to the fact Matthew de Grood killed five people and support the system in ensuring that he is not a threat to the public.
Every year that Matthew de Grood is reviewed we hope that our community will value the lives of Josh, Zack, Jordan, Kaiti and Lawrence and do what they can to support the five lives that de Grood ended.
A lot of discussion around these murders and trial are painful to think about and at times get away from the core of it. That five lives were taken away and countless others devastated by the actions of one person.
Unfortunately, no matter what the outcome is, or could have been, our loved ones Lawrence, Zack, Josh, Jordan and Kaiti are gone – and there is no changing that.
Those five young bright people will only smile in our memories, we can only hug them in our dreams, and every moment good or bad will be spent wishing they could share it with us. Their lives, our lives, their friends and the futures for all of us affected are forever changed.
Thank you for your attention.

Timeline of Events the Night of the Murders
This timeline of events comes directly from the court decision R. v. de Grood, 2016 ABQB 294.
On Monday, April 14, 2014, Matthew de Grood was scheduled to work a shift at Safeway between 2:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. He received a text that day from his childhood friend, Brendan McCabe, inviting him to a Bermuda Shorts Day party, an annual celebration of the last day of winter semester classes at the University of Calgary. The party was being held at 11 Butler Crescent in Calgary. Mr. McCabe lived in the house with four roommates: Sarah Kapiczowski, Teri Lewis, Michael “Joe” Regnault and Jordan Segura. The five roommates were all in their 20s and were either U of C students or starting their careers.
Mr. de Grood took the C-Train from Crowfoot station to Brentwood station. At 9 p.m., Mr. McCabe met Mr. de Grood at a Co-op gas station near Brentwood station as Mr. de Grood said he could not remember how to get to the house. He was still wearing his work uniform.
Approximately 25 to 35 people attended the party over the course of the night. Mr. de Grood was not observed to consume any alcohol or drugs over the course of the night. There were no confrontations between anyone at the party and Mr. de Grood, and he had no enemies at the party. The atmosphere of the party has been described as “laid back and relaxed” and everyone was in a good mood.
Just before 1:00 a.m. on April 15, 2014, Mr. McCabe, Mr. Regnault, Ms. Kapiczowski and Jayda Shreenan went to a nearby McDonald’s restaurant to pick up food. Ms. Kapiczowski drove them in her car. At the time, Ryle Lindenaar and Elizabeth Stockmal were sitting in Mr. Lindanaar’s car parked across the street from the house and Laura York went out to the car to join them.
Lawrence Hong, Joshua Hunter, Kaitlan Perras, Zackariah Rathwell, Jordan Segura, Teri Lewis and Matthew de Grood all remained in the house.
Mr. Hong was lying down and sleeping on a couch in the living room. Mr. Hunter, Ms. Perras and Mr. Segura were seated on a second couch facing the other. Mr. Rathwell and Mr. de Grood were in the kitchen. Ms. Lewis was lying in her bed in her upstairs bedroom, trying to fall asleep. There was no one else in the house.
Mr. de Grood picked up a chef’s knife from a knife block on an open shelf in the kitchen. The knife had a black handle with a single cutting edged, non-serrated blade that tapers into a sharp tip. The blade measured 21 centimeters in length by 4.6 centimeters in width at the widest point and had a thickness of 3 millimeters.
Using the knife, Mr. de Grood stabbed Mr. Rathwell seven times, Mr. Hunter six times, Mr. Segura once, Ms. Perras four times and Mr. Hong four times.
The stabbings occurred quickly and unexpectedly. The five victims had little, if any, opportunity to react. Mr. Rathwell was stabbed in the kitchen. Mr. Hunter and Mr. Segura were stabbed on or near the couch on which they were sitting and Ms. Perras was stabbed in the dining room as she tried to escape. Mr. Hong was asleep on the couch when he was stabbed.
After being stabbed, Mr. Hunter ran out the front door of the house just as the four individuals were returning from the McDonald’ restaurant. As they walked from the driveway towards the house, they heard Ms. Perras screaming inside the house and saw Mr. Hunter running out the door and across the front lawn. Mr. de Grood was chasing Mr. Hunter and held the knife in his hand.
Mr. de Grood chased Mr. Hunter southbound down Butler Crescent. Mr. McCabe ran after Mr. de Grood and caught up to him about 150 meters from the house. Mr. de Grood was holding the knife above his head with the blade pointed downward.
Mr. McCabe grabbed Mr. de Grood’s hand that was holding the knife and told him to give him the knife and to calm down. Mr. de Grood lowered his hand and released the knife to Mr. McCabe, which Mr. McCabe grabbed. The knife and Mr. de Grood’s gloved hands had blood on them.
Mr. Hunter returned to the house and collapsed on the front lawn.
Mr. de Grood told Mr. McCabe that it was “the night of the long knives” and took off running southbound towards Brentwood Boulevard. Mr. McCabe threw the knife onto the roadway and chased after Mr. de Grood, catching up to him after about 200 meters. Mr. McCabe grabbed Mr. de Grood and told him to calm down and come back to the house. Mr. de Grood pulled away and Mr. McCabe pushed Mr. de Grood up against a parked vehicle.
Mr. de Grood wiped his bloody hands on Mr. McCabe’s hands. He said that they were “blood brothers” and wanted Mr. McCabe to come with him.  He then told Mr. McCabe not to get in his way, or he would be next.  Mr. McCabe noticed that Mr. de Grood had his hand in his pocket, and he was worried that Mr. de Grood might still have a box-cutter with him, which had been noticed earlier in Mr. de Grood’s work uniform.
Mr. McCabe let Mr. de Grood go, and Mr. de Grood ran eastbound on Brentwood Boulevard.  Mr. McCabe ran back to the house.
Ms. Lewis, who had been in her upstairs bedroom at the time of the stabbings, had heard a male voice yelling words to the effect of “it’s okay, it’s cool — dude, calm down” and phoned 911.  Ms. Lewis went downstairs to find Mr. Rathwell, Mr. Segura, Ms. Perras and Mr. Hong injured. Mr. McCabe, who had already chased Mr. de Grood down the street, told Ms. Lewis that the perpetrator was Mr. de Grood.  Ms. Lewis provided Mr. de Grood’s name to the 911 operator.
Ms. Lewis, Ms. Shreenan, Ms. Kapiczowski and Mr. McCabe provided first aid to the victims inside the house. Mr. Regnault provided first aid to Mr. Hunter on the front lawn. Ms. Shreenan and Mr. Regnault also phoned 911. Mr. Regnault provided a description of Mr. de Grood to the 911 operator.
Between 1:21 a.m. and 1:23 a.m. on April 15, 2014, police received three separate 911 calls about a stabbing incident at the house and at 1:26 a.m., the first members of Calgary Police Service arrived on scene.
At 1:34 a.m., Emergency Medical Services confirmed that Mr. Rathwell, Mr. Segura and Mr. Hong were deceased.
At 1:39 a.m., Ms. Perras was transported from the scene to the Foothills Hospital where she was pronounced deceased at 3:00 a.m.
At 1:44 a.m., Mr. Hunter was transported from the scene to the Foothills Hospital where he was pronounced deceased at 2:17 a.m.

Killer’s Father, Douglas de Grood, Delivers Statement to Press Two Days After Murders
Two days after their son committed Calgary’s worst mass murder in history, Douglas and Susan de Grood bravely faced news cameras and Douglas delivered the following statement.
“I am Douglas de Grood and I am an inspector with the Calgary Police Service, but I am here today not as a police officer, but as a parent and a husband. I speak for my wife, Susan de Grood, as we are one voice.
“We are shocked and devastated and we are trying to make sense of what happened.
“We are deeply saddened for what the families and friends of the victims are going through. Your lives have been turned upside down. We know words cannot begin to ease your pain and suffering. Please accept our deepest condolences and know you are in our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers.
“Our condolences also go out to the first responders who attended the scene. You had to detach from your emotions to do your job. Your professionalism was exceptional.
“Like any parent can tell you, a love for your child is unconditional and we love Matthew dearly.
“Our Matthew is a great kid, full of love, kindness and respect for others. Growing up, he received good grades in school and was active in a variety of sports. As a young adult, he got a part-time job, entered university and became more involved in the community. He raised funds for charities through his passion for running. He had a bright future ahead of him as he was about to start law school in the fall.
“Just like you, we struggle to understand what happened. We have received an outpouring of support from our extended families, our friends and neighbours, co-workers and even people we have never met. We thank each one of you for your support. We will never recover from this, but the collective support has helped ease some of the pain.
“We hope someday we will have answers as to why this happened. Regardless, it won’t bring the victims back, but we would give anything to do just that.
“Our final words are to you, the media. We ask that you respect our family’s privacy as we deal with this tragedy.
“Thank you for your co-operation.”

Reminds me of that guy in California years ago who wanted to start a “race war”. and sent some women out to kill for him.  All these “nut jobs” seem to hear voices, usually a god of some sort.  I guess when civilians do it it isn’t called “national security”.  When presidents hear voices, it is usually over the telephone.

Looks like perpetrator played insane to have a “milder” sentencing, probably the lawyer advised to do so. A line that proved to be incredibly successful. How else one can defend himself to have 5 people killed and be out of prison in a couple of years? That was an incredibly well built defense indeed!
As to the victims, I wouldn’t make them as innocent as it’s portrayed. Those overcrowded parties are always full of drugs and decadence. Faces are not overly wrecked with signs of intellect either.

Lee Treit was, as they say in his unit, &#34;in the chute&#34; — on deck to lead the investigation into Calgary&#39;s next suspicious death.That was June 29, 2014, the last day Nathan O&#39;Brien, 5, and his grandparents, Alvin and Kathy Liknes, were seen alive when the boy stayed for a sleepover, snuggled into the same bed as his grandmother.When his mother arrived to pick him up the next day, Nathan and his grandparents were gone and there was blood all over the house.Treit was the officer in charge of the investigation, dubbed Operation Amber.Douglas Garland found guilty of murdering Calgary boy and grandparentsWhat the Garland murder trial jury didn&#39;t hear: His meth lab, identity theft and mental health issuesOne of the first things police did was issue an Amber Alert — the longest-running in Alberta&#39;s history — for Nathan.Seasoned detectives held out hope for days that the missing family members would be found alive, despite the pools of blood found in the Liknes home.But Operation Amber evolved into a mysterious triple homicide, even though the bodies of the the three family members were never found. Douglas Garland, 57, who lived on a farm near Airdrie, Alta., was charged with three counts of first-degree murder about two weeks after the trio went missing. Jurors are now deliberating his fate.&#39;People had to be told to go home&#39;At Garland&#39;s five-week trial, some of the evidence gathered by investigators, including dozens of exhibits, was laid out for the jury. About 1,400 pieces of evidence were gathered, although only 89 were presented in court.Treit agreed to speak with CBC News about the Garland case in an effort to give credit to the hundreds of fellow officers involved in Operation Amber. &#34;I can&#39;t remember going home,&#34; Treit says of the time between June 30, 2014, when the family was discovered missing and July 14, when Garland was charged with murder. During that time the detective&#39;s wife, who is also a police officer, would bring their newborn for visits to Calgary Police Service headquarters where homicide detectives were essentially living — working, eating and grabbing a couple hours sleep when possible.&#34;Two weeks of my life were one long day,&#34; Treit recalls.The detective and his partner, Det. John Orr, weren&#39;t the only ones working almost round the clock and sleeping on chairs for a couple of hours at a time. It was all hands on deck with every detective from both teams of the homicide unit involved in the investigation.Police do a grid search of a field north of Airdrie, Alta., on July 5, 2014. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)&#34;It wasn&#39;t a matter of asking; around here you don&#39;t have to ask,&#34; says Treit. &#34;Everybody just put their lives on complete hold ... people had to be told to go home.&#34;He estimates that 250 to 300 officers from every investigative department of the Calgary Police Service were involved.&#34;I never heard the word &#39;no,&#39; not once,&#34; says Treit of his co-workers. &#34;It was an incredible thing to be a part of.&#34;6 persons of interestIn the hours and days after the family disappeared, Treit enlisted the help of the RCMP, the Canada Border Services Agency, Passport Canada, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, U.S. Homeland Security and Mexican government officials. Though he was not called as a witness at Garland&#39;s trial, Treit testified in December 2016 about the timeline, direction and scope of the investigation at a court hearing — called a voir dire — to determine the admissibility of certain evidence.He testified that by the end of the first day of the investigation, investigators had compiled a list of six persons of interest. They included a local sex offender, a man who had shot Alvin Liknes&#39;s daughter years before, a former house guest of the Likneses, two disgruntled former employees of Alvin Liknes, and Douglas Garland. Investigators were assigned to interview each person and one by one they were all eliminated as possible suspects, except for Garland.1,300 tips from publicTreit worked closely with his partner, Det. John Orr, and Det. Dave Sweet, who was in charge of drafting search warrants that allowed officers access to the Garland farm and Liknes home. In two weeks, police received nearly 1,300 tips from the public. Just days into the investigation, calls, tips and updates attached to the original case number caused the police department&#39;s computer system to crash and a second number had to be assigned.Among the many tips received was one that the family had been spotted in Hinton, Alta., which was checked out by Det. Mike Cavilla who was in charge of following up on possible leads.The investigators&#39; hub, or control centre, was the homicide board room. Treit barely left the room along with a scribe who recorded everything from witness statements to resource requests and phone calls. The early days were spent delving into the finances of the Likneses, canvassing neighbours, reviewing CCTV footage, and organizing press conferences; one for the O&#39;Briens to make a public plea for the return of Nathan, and another for police to ask those who attended an estate sale the Likneses held on the day they disappeared to volunteer to be fingerprinted and tell police the items they&#39;d purchased.Above and beyondPolice were contacted on July 3, 2014, by Cenovus Energy, the company that employed Nathan&#39;s father, Rod O&#39;Brien, which offered to finance a ransom if a request for money in return for the family members was made. Had a ransom demand been made, Treit says Calgary Police Service policies on hostages would have kicked in, meaning the robbery unit and negotiators would get involved.&#34;We knew if that aspect reared its head ... we would have to give that part of the investigation over to those units,&#34; says Treit.That same day, the RCMP offered to fast track any exhibits local police could get to the crime lab in Edmonton.&#34;They were giving us a turnaround time of three to five days which is virtually unheard of,&#34; says Treit. &#34;So that was a priority.&#34;Swabs taken from the bloodied Liknes home were driven to Edmonton where Treit says lab technicians were waiting at the door for Calgary officers.&#34;At the crime lab, the employees there had the door open when investigators arrived and they were going straight into the lab with these exhibits,&#34; he says.Defence tries to have evidence tossedIn November and December 2016, defence lawyers Kim Ross and Jim Lutz fought to have evidence gathered from the Garland farm during and after a warrantless search, deemed inadmissible at their client&#39;s murder trial. But their request was denied.On July 4, 2014, after police were pointed in Garland&#39;s direction — by his sister and brother-in-law — Treit acted quickly, directing a search of the farm, even though police did not have a warrant, believing the family members might still be alive. The law does allow for searches under &#34;exigent circumstances.&#34;But that search was only supposed to be in areas where Nathan, and the Likneses could be hidden. Police were not to look in smaller spaces until a warrant had been drafted.Officers conduct a fingertip search on the Garland farm looking for evidence. (Court exhibit)One RCMP officer did look in a duffle bag and found handcuffs, a large knife and a billy club — which the Crown would later refer to as Garland&#39;s &#34;capture kit.&#34;When officers arrived at the farm, a burn barrel was still smouldering and the hope of finding the family alive began to fade. &#34;Myself, in my heart, I had moved past the idea that we were looking for a live body on the farm,&#34; says Det. Sweet.The investigation didn&#39;t end after Garland was behind bars. A Calgary police officer spent 10 months sifting through ashes found on the Garland farm looking for evidence.When asked how he feels about his role as leader of the investigation, Treit is humble. &#34;I&#39;m never going to take credit for this, not one iota. It was a complete and total team effort,&#34; he says. See the latest updates in live tweets from CBC reporters in the courtroom. On mobile?

He attended medical school in Alberta for one year before suffering a mental breakdown, according to a Tax Court of Canada document.But there is more to the story of Garland&#39;s failed attempt at med school, according to two former classmates who attended the University of Alberta at the same time as he did in 1987. Garland was suspected of cheating in his first few months in the program. One of his professors set him up on a test and caught him in the act, say the former classmates.After being voted class president just months earlier, he was kicked out of medical school.Criminal allegationsGarland faced criminal charges in the late &#39;80s and &#39;90s, but they were either stayed or withdrawn. Among them were two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon in 1988 and 1999 and an assault charge in 1989.In 1992, RCMP busted an elaborate methamphetamine lab on the Airdrie farm where Garland lived with his parents. The  33-year-old was charged with drug trafficking and possession of stolen property.He attended his first court appearance, but while out on bail he fled to British Columbia where he lived under a false identity for seven years. Douglas Garland has a criminal history, including drug trafficking and possession of stolen property. (Calgary Herald)He assumed the identify of Matthew Kemper Hartley, a 14-year-old boy who was killed in a car crash in 1980 in Cardston, Alta., according to a document from the Tax Court of Canada. For much of the time he was in B.C., he worked at a private lab in Vancouver. After being fired, he collected unemployment benefits under the dead boy&#39;s name.When it was later discovered that he had collected benefits using a false identity, he wound up in tax court where a  judge described him as intelligent, but said he had attention deficit disorder and suffered from breakdowns.Though jurors in the triple murder trial heard that documents with the name Matthew Kemper Hartley on them were found hidden in the basement rafters of Garland&#39;s home, prosecutors could not delve further into their significance.Considered &#34;bad character evidence,&#34; that type of information is inadmissible because of the danger it poses in swaying  jurors and possibly biasing them toward conviction.Douglas Garland killed Calgary couple and grandson over &#39;petty grudge,&#39; court hearsGarland&#39;s sister pointed police to her brother as suspect, jurors in triple murder trial hearTriple murder trial sees &#39;very graphic&#39; evidence found on hard driveGarland returned to Calgary in 2000 after he was caught living in Vancouver and pleaded guilty to several of the charges in connection with the drug bust and stolen identity.​He told the court at the time he had been traumatized after causing what he described as a horrific accident after falling asleep behind the wheel years earlier.The judge gave Garland a three-year sentence to be served in a federal prison. The Parole Board of Canada released him after just six months.Garland&#39;s mental health played a role in his crimes, board members said, and a psychologist determined that he had &#34;little violence potential to others.&#34;The board ordered that a psychologist and psychiatrist closely monitor him during his release. Person of interestGarland became a person of interest and then a suspect a few days after Nathan and his grandparents went missing. Police initially charged him with identity theft when documents and a bank card bearing the dead Matthew Hartley&#39;s name were found during searches of the Airdrie farm.Though the charge was later stayed, police used it to impose court-ordered conditions on Garland and investigators were tasked with his close surveillance.Nathan O&#39;Brien, 5, had been sleeping over at the home of his grandparents, Kathy and Alvin Liknes, in June 2014 when the three disappeared. (Calgary Police Service)Garland was staying at the Motel 6 in Airdrie when he snuck out in the early morning hours of July 14, and appeared to be heading in the direction of the Airdrie farm.He was arrested and held for questioning until the morning of July 15, when he was formally charged with three counts of first-degree murder.A first-degree murder conviction comes with an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years. Garland could potentially face a sentence that would not allow him to apply for parole for 75 years.CBC&#39;s Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Douglas Garland found guilty of murdering Calgary boy and grandparents The never-before-heard details of the Douglas Garland investigation from lead detective LIVE BLOG | Latest updates from Douglas Garland triple murder trial in CalgaryFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

The Alberta Court of Appeal will release a decision on the three killers&#39; sentences today. (Left, Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press; right, RCMP)Alberta&#39;s top court has supported consecutive sentences for three triple murderers, including a man who killed a Calgary couple and their grandson and a central Albertan who killed his parents and sister with a friend.The Alberta Court of Appeal upheld a life sentence with no chance of parole for 75 years for Douglas Garland, who killed five-year-old Nathan O&#39;Brien and his grandparents, Alvin and Kathy Liknes, in Calgary in 2014.Garland unsuccessfully appealed his 75-year-parole ineligibility, imposed by the trial judge as consecutive — rather than concurrent — sentences.The court also ruled Monday on a second case involving Jason Klaus and Joshua Frank, who killed Klaus&#39;s parents, Gordon and Sandra Klaus, and his sister, Monica Klaus, in 2013 at the victims&#39; home on a farm near Castor, about 140 kilometres east of Red Deer. The two men were given life sentences but the trial judge imposed concurrent parole ineligibilities, meaning the killers could apply for parole in 25 years.On Monday, the majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal panel allowed the appeal, finding the trial judge&#39;s sentence &#34;disproportionate and unfit.&#34;The higher court has imposed a 50-year parole ineligibility, with the men to serve their sentences for Monica Klaus&#39;s killing consecutive to the parents. Crime &#39;cheaper by the dozen&#39;: Crown says in arguing triple murderers should spend minimum 75 years in prison One judge dissentedJustice Frans Slatter offered a dissenting opinion on both cases. In both cases, Slatter questioned whether Parliament intended consecutive periods of parole ineligibility to be imposed when an accused is simultaneously convicted of more than one murder.Slatter also took issue with the parole ineligibility increments of 25, 50 or 75 years, calling the choice a &#34;blunt instrument.&#34;&#34;It prevents a sentencing judge from carefully balancing the many factors that go into achieving a proportional and individualized sentence,&#34; wrote Slatter in his dissent. &#34;An alternative solution to the identified problem of &#39;volume discounts&#39; for multiple murders would be to permit sentencing judges to incrementally increase the period of parole ineligibility in those cases, to some fixed limit.&#34;The bodies of Kathy and Alvin Liknes and their grandson Nathan O&#39;Brien have never been found, but DNA from all three was discovered at a farm just north of Calgary where Douglas Garland lived with his parents. (Coronationfuneralhome.ca)Boy, grandparents killedA Calgary jury found Garland guilty in 2017 of the first-degree murders of O&#39;Brien and the Likneses. On June 29, 2014, Nathan had been at his grandparents for a sleepover. When the boy&#39;s mother arrived to pick him up, all three family members were gone and the home was covered in blood. In its appeal, the prosecution argued Garland&#39;s sentence should reflect his decision to kill the child witness rather than leave him. The never-before-heard details of the Douglas Garland investigation from lead detective The three family members were attacked at the home before Garland took them in his pickup truck to his parent&#39;s farm near Airdrie. There, he disposed of the bodies.Bone fragments, flesh and teeth were found in a burn pit on the property. A chance fly-by by an aerial mapping plane showed the three bodies laid out on the farm.At trial, the Crown presented evidence that Garland was angry with Alvin Liknes over a dispute regarding a patent for an oilfield pump the two had worked on together. Prosecutors argued this hostility built up to the point where Garland meticulously plotted the killings.Sandra, Gordon and Monica Klaus were murdered December 8, 2013. (Facebook)Killers confess to policeKlaus and Frank were found guilty on three counts of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting deaths of Gordon, Sandra and Monica Klaus at the victims&#39; home on a farm near Castor.The killers set the house on fire afterward.Klaus was set to inherit the family farm after the deaths. Evidence presented at trial showed he had cocaine and gambling addictions and was in financial trouble. Klaus became worried his parents would find out he had been stealing money from them and forging cheques, and offered Frank money to help kill his family. Crime &#39;cheaper by the dozen&#39;: CrownBoth men confessed to police during an undercover operation.Those killers will be able to apply for parole after 25 years.In arguing Klaus and Frank&#39;s sentence appeal, prosecutor Iwona Kuklicz said the killers were handed a sentence that sent a message their crimes were &#34;cheaper by the dozen.&#34; Kuklicz asked the panel of judges to impose a 75-year-term before the two could apply for parole. Regardless, lawyers in both cases say they expect to seek leave to appeal from the country&#39;s top court. Klaus&#39;s lawyer, Michael Bates, as well as Frank&#39;s lawyer, Andrea Urquhart, both say they are awaiting instructions from their clients but expect to be asking the Supreme Court of Canada to hear the case. Kim Ross, one of Garland&#39;s lawyers, says he is reviewing the decision and also anticipates taking the sentence appeal to the Supreme Court. In November, in a unanimous decision, Quebec&#39;s Court of Appeal reduced Alexandre Bissonnette&#39;s  life sentence to 25 years without parole while at the same time invalidating sections of the Criminal Code that allow judges to hand out consecutive life sentences for murder.Bissonnette killed six people in a Quebec City mosque in 2017. The Appeal Court ruled his life sentence with no chance of parole for 40 years amounted to &#34;cruel and unusual&#34; punishment.It is possible the Supreme Court of Canada could hear the Bissonnette and Alberta cases together. CorrectionsAn earlier version of this story said the convicted in both triple murder cases had an automatic right to have their sentence appeals heard by the Supreme Court of Canada. While that is the case on conviction appeals, it&#39;s not the case on sentence appeals. So the lawyers for all three men would have to apply for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.Feb 08, 2021 1:59 PM MTABOUT THE AUTHORMeghan GrantCBC Calgary crime reporterMeghan Grant is a justice affairs reporter.

The Renfrew County Murders Are Not An Anomaly
Everyone knew Basil Borutski was dangerous, and he had the criminal record to prove it. Then, in 2015, he killed three women in a single day, all of whom feared him. This week, Borutski was found guilty, but the case stands as a condemnation of an entire system’s failure to protect women.
By Sarah Boesveld
Updated November 28, 2017
Anastasia Kuzyk, Nathalie Warmerdam and Carol Culleton were murdered by Basil Borutski in 2015. Warmerdam photo courtesy of COPKA. Kuzyk and Culleton photos via Facebook.
On a clear September morning in 2015, 57-year-old Basil Borutski left his apartment in the Eastern Ontario hamlet of Palmer Rapids for the very last time. He slid behind the wheel of a silver Chrysler Cirrus borrowed from a friend, drove by thick forests, through the quaint village of Combermere and pulled up beside a small brown cottage on Lake Kamaniskeg. He had spent a lot of time there that summer, fixing up the property and trying to get closer to its owner, Carol Culleton, a 66-year-old public servant from the Ottawa area he’d casually dated a few years before. Culleton had grown tired of Borutski’s recent advances and repeatedly told him to stay away. Just two days earlier, she let him know she was seeing someone else. Borutski arrived at her cottage in a jealous rage. After Culleton locked him out, he smashed the front door window, let himself in and wound a coaxial television cable around Culleton’s neck and jaw, cutting off her airway. He left her body slumped on the floor beside her bed, covered in a blanket.
Borutski headed back outside and, in Culleton’s Mazda 3, drove 30 km to Wilno, arriving at the home of his former girlfriend, Anastasia Kuzyk, just before 9 a.m. The 36-year-old didn’t recognize the car that pulled into her driveway, but she knew the bald, burly man who stepped out of it. She’d lived in fear of Borutski for more than a year. Her sister, Eva, who was staying with her at the time, was folding sheets on the bed upstairs when she heard a scream. Eva came downstairs and saw Kuzyk cowering behind the kitchen island. “It’s Basil,” Kuzyk whispered to Eva, who looked up and saw a man through the window. Eva ran outside and told Borutski she’d kill him if he hurt her sister. He went to his car and pulled out a gun. Then she ran as fast as she could, in her bare feet, to call for help. Within seconds, she heard him shoot. Kuzyk died of a gunshot wound on her kitchen floor.
Borutski’s third victim that day, his ex-girlfriend Nathalie Warmerdam, 48, had taken precautions since their relationship ended three years earlier. She kept a gun beside her bed and regularly wore a panic button that would alert police to his presence when pressed. That morning, as she sat down to breakfast at her home in Foymount, a small community east of Wilno, Borutski burst through the front door. Her 20-year-old son, Adrian, was watching TV on the couch in the living room and heard his mother scream. At first he thought she had seen a spider. But Warmerdam kept screaming as Borutski chased her through the main floor. Adrian fled out the back and heard the gunshot that killed his mother as his feet hit the driveway. Borutski fled in Culleton’s car, and drove until police arrested him after a five-hour manhunt just outside Ottawa, 100 km away.

More than two years later, in an Ottawa courtroom on Nov. 24, 2017, Basil Borutski was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Kuzyk and Warmerdam and of second-degree murder in the death of Culleton. Over the course of 19 days, the jury heard the mountain of evidence linking Borutski to the killings, including a remorseless confession Borutski gave police the day after the murders and DNA evidence of the women’s blood on his clothing. Silent throughout the trial, Borutski, now 60, refused to enter a plea, didn’t hire a lawyer and said nothing in his defence before the jury. He will be sentenced a in Pembroke court on Dec. 5 and 6, the 28th anniversary of the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre and the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women.
The details of Borutski’s case are exceptional: Rarely has a perpetrator killed three former partners in the span of mere hours. The general pattern, however, is anything but. The well-documented escalating history of violence that characterized Borutski’s relationship with these women precedes three out of four cases of domestic homicide in this country. The recent spate of mass shootings in the United States has highlighted the link between domestic abuse and gun violence — 54 percent of these killings between 2009 and 2016 were linked to domestic or family violence, according to an analysis by gun safety advocates Everytown USA. And the ineffectuality of law enforcement and the justice system in preventing domestic homicides is sadly familiar. On average, a woman is murdered by her intimate partner every six days in Canada, according to national homicide statistics. Indigenous women in Canada are eight times more likely to be victims of a domestic homicide. Each year, the Department of Justice estimates $7.4 billion of taxpayer dollars a year are spent dealing with the aftermath of domestic violence.
What the Renfrew County murders tell us about rural violence
Before the murders, Basil Borutski had faced more than 30 criminal charges in his life — most of them related to intimate partner violence — and had been convicted of nearly half of them. At the time of the murders, he was on probation and subject to a weapons ban. While one of his victims clipped a panic button to her belt each morning when she dressed, Borutski was under no such surveillance — even with his history of repeatedly breaching probation, ignoring weapons bans and carrying out increasingly violent incidents. After serving one sentence for domestic assault, Borutski flat-out refused to sign an agreement saying he’d stay away from his victim, but walked out of prison just the same. Nine months later, three women were dead.
The triple homicide in Renfrew County is one of the most extreme cases of multi-partner domestic homicide this country has ever seen. In this sense, it should have become a galvanizing case in a Canada perhaps more attuned to violence against women than ever before. But more than two years later, little has changed. If the statistical pattern holds, another 150 Canadian women will have died at the hands of their partners since the murders of Culleton, Kuzyk and Warmerdam, but few of them ever capture the public’s attention. Now, as Borutski awaits sentencing, the deaths of these three women serve as a symbol of our inability to keep perpetrators like him from slipping through the cracks. “I think this case represents a condemnation of the entire system that is supposedly there to protect women but isn’t,” said Leighann Burns, executive director of Ottawa’s Harmony House shelter, on the courthouse steps after the verdict. “Starting tomorrow, what are we going to do to make things different for all of the other women who come forward and disclose the violence in their lives?”

Renfrew County is as sprawling as it is beautiful — dotted with glittering lakes surrounded by forest. Geographically, it’s larger than Prince Edward Island, with a rocky Canadian Shield landscape that makes lumber more lucrative than farming, and the local economy is largely seasonal thanks to cottagers from Ottawa to the east and Toronto to the southwest. Highway 60, which links the area’s small communities, now has signs warning night drivers of deer, but in the early 1990s, there were billboards with a message for local men: “Don’t beat a woman.” The working-class county was, back then, the subject of a documentary about domestic violence. Four years ago, the Renfrew County Committee of Abused Women got a monument erected in memory of all the women killed by their partners in the area since 1969 — the first names of 19 women, aged 16 to 55, were carved into a nearly six-foot-tall slab of rock on the banks of the Petawawa River.
Despite its vastness, Renfrew County is still very small. Families are interconnected and people don’t tend to move away, says JoAnne Brooks, executive director of the Women’s Sexual Assault Centre of Renfrew County, who moved to this part of the Ottawa Valley from Southern Ontario in 1981. That means the responding police officer or emergency room triage nurse might well be someone you know. There’s a real “truck culture,” she says, and the area is “very conservative” in its views on gender.
Basil Joseph Borutski is a native son of Renfrew County, and a notorious figure in this close-knit area. He was the third of eight children born to Walter and Beatrice, second-generation Polish immigrants, and grew up in a bright blue house on the edge of the Round Lake. His father worked as a trapper and he had a strained relationship with his mother, who ruled the house, says a former childhood friend. “She didn’t treat [Borutski] well — that was well known,” the friend says.

Borutski’s strained romantic relationships began in his 20s, when a girlfriend named Lynn moved with him from Kitchener to Round Lake. According to the friend, Lynn stayed in the area for less than a year, but “left as fast as she’d come” after Borutski started hitting her.
Not long after the breakup, Borutski got together with a woman from Round Lake, named Mary Ann Mask. Their abusive on-and-off relationship spanned more than 25 years. At the couple’s 2011 divorce proceedings, two of their children recalled Mask being nearly pushed out of a moving vehicle and returning from an encounter with Borutski bloodied. According to divorce documents, Mask would make allegations against Borutski and then take them back, even after police had laid charges. “She kept recanting and kept getting beat up,” says the former childhood friend, who also knew Mask. “She wouldn’t personally come and tell me what he was doing, but people sort of knew what was going on.”
After he and Mask split for good, Borutski aimed his violence at a string of other women — remaining true to a pattern experts in six provinces have identified through their annual reviews of domestic homicides. He met and quickly moved in with Nathalie Warmerdam, a hospice nurse who was caring for his father and in the midst of a separation from her husband. “Anything you need to know about Basil can be summed up by the fact that his father was dying in hospice and he was hitting on his father’s nurse,” says Danielle Pécore-Ugorji, a close friend of Warmerdam’s, who used to work at a rape crisis centre.
But Borutski charmed Warmerdam, in part with a hard-luck story — Warmerdam believed him when he said his ex-wife was out to get him, and even supported him in court proceedings against her. “He was telling [my mother] she was beautiful, telling her she was the most amazing woman in the world,” says Warmerdam’s daughter, Valerie. “She was head over heels.” Borutski seemed normal at first, says Valerie, and then became manipulative and controlling, isolating Warmerdam from her friends and family. He drank heavily and berated Valerie and her brother, Adrian, who was also the target of increasingly violent threats from Borutski. “We all lived under a cloud of fear that Basil might ‘blow up,’” says Nathalie’s ex-husband, Frank, also the father of her children.

In August 2012, after months of escalating tension, Warmerdam reported Borutski to police. She stopped at a station in London, Ont. where she had driven to pick up Adrian from a gaming camp. “Basil did say [to my mother], ‘If Mary Ann ever puts me in jail, don’t wait for me because if I get out, I’m going to kill her.’ Clearly the same rules should apply [to her], right?” Valerie says. “She didn’t want to be anywhere near him when this might go down.” He was charged with assault, but Warmerdam was reluctant to testify. In the end, Borutski was convicted of uttering threats and sentenced to 150 days in jail, minus the 117 he’d spent in custody. “We all stupidly breathed a sigh of relief,” says Warmerdam’s mom, Maz Tracey. “Little did we realize just how much danger she was still in.”
This would be the first time Borutski was put behind bars for domestic violence (he’d successfully appealed a conviction related to his run-ins with Mask), and it angered him. The court ordered Borutski to attend Living Without Violence, the county’s only partner-assault-response program, meant to teach abusers healthier ways to deal with their anger. Ironically, it was located across the street from Warmerdam’s work. Every day she feared running into Borutski — she backed into parking spaces in case she needed a quick escape, rented the panic button she kept by her pillow, and bought a gun, which she stashed under her bed. But Borutski never showed up for the counselling, says program facilitator Mike Richard. It was one of many times Borutski disobeyed a court order with little or no consequence.
The home of Anastasia Kuzyk.
Run-ins with police now became part of Borutski’s beleaguered personal narrative, one he used to disarm his next target, a casual friend named Anastasia Kuzyk. She was a local realtor and a beloved server at the Wilno Tavern, one of the few nightlife spots in the area. Borutski had a reputation there — when he occasionally dropped by, some locals would move to the other end of the bar to steer clear of the guy who’d posted a list of enemies on a makeshift sign at the end of his driveway. But Kuzyk got closer to him and let him help her around the house. She had just gotten out of an emotionally abusive relationship in late 2013 and Borutski came forward “as a protector,” says her friend Johanna Zomers. Borutski wove a story that he was a victim of his exes, and of the police, too. If Kuzyk was aware that another server at the tavern had charged Borutski with criminal harassment in 2010 — the woman alleged he called her incessantly and repeatedly showed up at her home following their break-up — she looked past it. (The charge never went anywhere.) “She was quite charmed and didn’t believe some of the warnings other women were giving her,” says Tavern owner Corinne Higgins.
It didn’t take long before Borutski became manipulative and controlling with Kuzyk, too. Friends say he would come by the home drunk, demanding sex. “Basil couldn’t take no for an answer — when you defied him, he had this huge anger,” says Zomers. On one such occasion, Kuzyk wouldn’t comply, and according to court documents, Borutski beat her to the point that she begged him to kill her. Kuzyk called police after another argument days later, and he was charged with assault, choking and mischief for setting fire to her belongings, and taken into pre-trial custody. At Warmerdam’s urging, Kuzyk testified against him in court. (The two women had met when Borutski was living with Warmerdam.) Borutski was found guilty of choking Kuzyk and sentenced to 17 months in prison and two years’ probation. Five months later, having served a year in pre-trial custody, he was released and ordered to attend the Living Without Violence program he had previously shirked. For the second time, he never showed.

By the summer of 2015, Borutski fit the profile of a domestic abuser to a tee. He had racked up 14 convictions in three years, violated court orders and refused to promise to keep away from Kuzyk and not possess weapons. (The Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services has not commented on the case.) Borutski was also unemployed, broke and living in a social housing apartment complex in isolated Palmer Rapids, a town nearly an hour’s drive from Round Lake and not far from where Al Capone hid out from the FBI in the 1940s. Getting by on a disability pension he received after a 1994 car accident, Borutski eased his back pain with rye and Percocet. He picked up odd jobs here and there, including for his former casual girlfriend, Carol Culleton, a soon-to-retire public servant who was widowed and fixing her cottage to sell.
Culleton’s neighbours say she complained about Borutski’s shoddy workmanship and suggested he might be trying to sabotage her efforts to sell the cottage. Also concerning was his jealous and threatening behaviour. On one occasion, he showed up at her home in North Gower, without her having given him her address. Culleton started to get spooked, and her friends warned her that this was dangerous behaviour. In the weeks before the murders, Borutski and Culleton were at a party and Culleton sat on another man’s lap. It angered Borutski, who wanted to pursue a relationship, though she’d previously shunned his advances. He texted Culleton incessantly. On the Friday before he killed her, Culleton retired as a public servant. On Sunday, she texted Borutski to say she was seeing another man and to “please stop.” Culleton returned to her cottage Monday morning to find Borutski had posted menacing signs around her property, one of which said “Happy Positive Retirement – Sorry I’m Such an Asshole.” She texted her boyfriend that night to say she was keeping her phone by her pillow in case she needed to call 911 — determined to stick around for an appointment with realtor Cathy Pitts on Tuesday in order to put her cottage on the market. When Pitts arrived for their meeting, she found the front window of the cottage smashed and asked the next-door neighbours for help. Once inside, Pitts discovered Culleton’s body.

Everyone — from the courts to the locals to the police to the shelter and sexual assault centre — knew Borutski could potentially cause greater harm. So why couldn’t they stop him?
“Doing this work, there are people who say, ‘Oh, you really can’t do anything — if somebody wants to kill somebody they’re just going to do it.’ Well, that’s simply not true,” says national domestic homicide researcher Peter Jaffe. Every year, provincial death review committees comb through the histories attached to their domestic homicide cases looking for patterns, and there are many programs in place to deal with offenders like Borutski. Police officers throughout Canada are trained in the nuances of this kind of violence, too, particularly since it’s the most common call they get. Across the country, Mandatory Domestic Violence High Risk Committees, made up of local Crown, police and social-services agencies, meet twice a month to discuss cases where they might need to intervene. The victim or their representative is often present.
Most Canadian provinces also have special domestic violence courts with judges and Crown attorneys specially trained in the complexities of this type of crime — all 54 court jurisdictions in Ontario have them. But according to a 2011 analysis of these courts by University of Ottawa criminologist Holly Johnson, in which Renfrew County women were interviewed, “women lack choice and control over critical decisions during court proceedings.” And while most provinces have counselling and support for perpetrators, Ontario, for one, has shortened the length of its Partner Assault Response programs, the kind Borutski was supposed to attend, from 16 weeks to 12.
That Borutski passed through the criminal justice system and went on to kill the very women he’d been charged with harming in the past exposes a wide gap in these processes, says activist lawyer Pamela Cross, who works with victims of domestic violence. “Here’s somebody who’s got a long track record [of violence] and, in many cases, charges were stayed,” she says. “I would hope most judges would say, ‘There’s a clear and persistent pattern of behaviour here — we need to do more than give a tap on the wrist.”
And without monitoring and oversight, court orders are useless, says Jancy Brown, public education coordinator at Renfrew County’s sexual assault centre. “A piece of paper can’t stop a bullet,” she says. As one of her clients put it, court orders can be like waving a red flag in front of a bull. In fact, for many women, reaching out for help means putting themselves at greater risk of abuse at the hands of their partner. Research shows 25 percent of women murdered in Canada by their spouse had left their relationship not long before they were killed. In one study, half of the murdered women were slain within two months of breaking it off.
Risk factors vary among women, too. Rates of domestic violence against Indigenous women are three times higher than for non-Indigenous women. Immigrant and refugee women are more likely to be killed and also the least likely to access services. Rural women, are also considered vulnerable. A 20-year U.S. study found more domestic violence in rural areas than in urban ones, and a 2016 report from New Brunswick found that this combination — scant services, isolation and a lack of anonymity — kept women in abusive relationships.

In the case of Renfrew County, “it’s very multi-layered and very complex,” says local sexual-assault centre executive director JoAnne Brooks. There’s the isolation, the high poverty and addiction rates. There is zero public transportation and patchy cell service. Warmerdam’s panic button, for example, was meant to elicit immediate response from police when pressed, but she would likely have to wait at least 40 minutes for them to arrive, Brooks says. Then there’s the hunting culture. A 2015 University of Western Ontario study on the differences between urban and rural domestic homicides found perpetrators in rural areas are far more likely to have access to a gun and use it to kill their partner. The realities of rural women facing domestic violence are only starting to be studied in a comprehensive way, by researchers like Jaffe at the University of Western Ontario, who recently received a federal grant to study how to prevent domestic homicide in vulnerable populations.
“It’s not a surprise that rural populations are recognized in many countries as facing increased vulnerabilities in many areas, including violence against women,” says Myrna Dawson, a co-director of the federal grant with Jaffe and the Canada Research Chair in Public Policy in Criminal Justice at the University of Guelph. “Practically speaking, it is often that [the women] just have nowhere to go and oftentimes, if they did, no way to get there.”
And all women face serious barriers to engaging with the criminal system in cases of domestic violence; 70 percent of spousal abuse is not reported to the police, according to Statistics Canada. Many who do report fear testifying against their abuser face-to-face — something the women in Borutski’s life were extremely hesitant to do. When victims don’t testify in domestic-violence cases, a conviction is unlikely and charges are often stayed or dropped. Kuzyk’s friend, Ann Fleming, spent the year after her murder lobbying then-interim federal Conservative leader Rona Ambrose to prepare a private members’ bill that would give victims the option to testify by video link, as child victims often do. Ambrose instead introduced the JUST Act, to require judges hearing sexual assault cases to have specialized, up-to-date training. Fleming calls it “a start.” Ambrose’s bill is still at Senate level.
The trouble is, even with multiple efforts to improve the status quo, domestic homicide presents a unique challenge that’s part jurisdictional (murder is a federal crime the provinces prosecute), part sociological (it’s tough to get women to come forward with complaints, particularly in certain communities) and part ethical (is it fair to restrict a person’s liberties to prevent a crime they may or may not commit?). There’s also a not insignificant economic factor: Governments and institutions face constant pressure to cut costs. Probation officers are oversubscribed: The Renfrew office has three officers who supervise 168 clients. “We recognize that though we’ve made progress, we still have work to do to reduce each officer’s caseload,” Ontario’s Corrections ministry said in an emailed statement.
And across the country, there is a patchwork of policies with different levels of care. Ontario created its Domestic Violence Death Review Committee in 2003, for instance. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan — which has the highest rate of domestic homicide in the country — conducted its first review of domestic homicides in 2016. Likewise, police don’t all use the same risk assessment tools. “If you’re a domestic violence victim,” says Western’s Peter Jaffe, “it shouldn’t matter whether you live in Yellowknife or Churchill or Kitchener — you should be expecting similar police standards.” Jaffe’s team is working to create a national database of domestic homicide prevention tools that will help improve the response across Canada. The federal grant Jaffe received was a long time coming — governments have known the urgency of the problem in rural communities for years. A 2008 Senate report on rural poverty in Canada highlighted domestic violence in rural Canada as one of two pressing crime-related issues that needed federal attention, Dawson points out, adding that it identified “inadequate services” as part of the problem. “I am not sure what has changed since then, if anything.”
That said, “I think we’re probably at a tipping point for social change,” Jaffe says. Governments have started taking action, but the progress is slow and halting. 2012, Manitoba launched a multi-year domestic violence prevention strategy. Nova Scotia, British Columbia and Ontario have followed suit. The Liberals have sent the message that they take violence against women seriously with its gender-based violence strategy, although they’ve been criticized for mishandling the national inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women. In her mandate letter from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould was directed to toughen up criminal laws and bail conditions related to domestic assault. A Department of Justice spokesperson said they are actively working to fulfill this commitment.
Conservative Status of Women critic Rachael Harder favours a crackdown on repeat offenders and points to the Harper government’s measures to better protect victims, including eliminating the use of conditional sentencing and house arrest for serious offenders and sex crimes registries. But neither of those measures prevented Warmerdam, Kuzyk or Culleton from being murdered, and for that, she blames a breakdown in the justice system. “It really is up to the judicial body to then take those legislative acts and enforce them or interpret them in their rulings,” she says. “I would say, in this case, that wasn’t done adequately.”
Harder also believes it should be required by law for police and courts to notify victims when their abusers are released from prison — Kuzyk was not notified when Borutski was released back into the community after serving nine months’ time for assaulting her.
Another possible solution favoured by some tough-on-crime proponents is to label more repeat offenders of domestic violence as dangerous offenders, a rare designation for especially violent perpetrators. Some American courts have “dangerousness hearings,” designed to assess whether someone charged with domestic violence is at risk of re-offending, and soon. We don’t have those in Canada, and that may be for good reason, says lawyer Pamela Cross. “Are we going to deny bail to every man who’s charged with, say, their second or third domestic assault? The jails don’t have room for them. They’re not guilty until they’ve been proven guilty. It’s hardly going to help them learn better behaviour, it might make them angrier.” In the meantime, new danger assessment tools are being used more and more to help women come up with a better safety plan. The onus still remains on the woman.
The WIlno Tavern is a well-known local gathering spot.
This week, a scraggly long-haired and goateed Basil Borutski sat despondently in the prisoner’s box as a woman jury foreman delivered the trio of guilty verdicts on Friday. He will not be eligible for parole for at least 25 years, and will more than likely spend the rest of his life behind bars. As the judge wrapped up the trial, Borutski yawned repeatedly, as if bored by an entire process in which he refused to participate.
A lot has changed in Renfrew County since the murders shattered the community — and a lot has remained the same. Last July, the Ontario government announced $1 million to fund 16 rural, remote and northern anti-violence against women agencies, which has helped them boost resources, for the short term anyway. The local women’s shelter in Renfrew County got $8,000 of it, and used it to train staffers to identify service gaps in the region. But the murders have struck fear into the area. Many people who knew Borutski were reluctant to speak for this story — afraid he’d be released from prison with an even longer list of enemies. The local sexual assault centre now regularly hears from women whose abusive partners use the murders as a warning. Other women see shades of Borutski in their partners and reach out for help. “This act of violence opened up the door for lots of uncomfortable conversations about our lives and about how many of us have been in abusive relationships at one time or another,” says Maureen MacMillan, a neighbour of Kuzyk’s in Wilno. “It also made us realize that we need to stretch our arms out a little further, to ensure some of our fellow sisters have some safe arms to fall into if they need them.”
Warmerdam’s friend, Danielle Pécore-Ugorji, expressed relief at the jury’s decision. “I feel satisfied with the verdict. The man is 60 years old, he is not getting out of prison before he dies,” she says. “But I’m very cautious with the word ‘justice’ because there is no justice in this case. We can’t bring these women back.”
On occasion throughout the trial, Pécore-Ugorji has visited the monument to women killed by their partners that stands by the Petawawa River. “There’s definitely a spiritual sense of peace there,” she says. She expects to travel directly to the monument after the sentencing hearing on Dec. 6. “We know there are more women’s names that are going to be added to that monument,” she says. The last three were inscribed in a single day. Anastasia. Nathalie. Carol.
