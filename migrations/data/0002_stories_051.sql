Neighbours say Villi had a history of erratic behaviour and conflict with the building’s condo board.A 73-year-old man who fatally shot five people at an upscale condo tower north of Toronto in Vaughan, Ont., used a semi-automatic handgun and victims were found on several different floors of the building, the province&#39;s police watchdog said Monday.At a news conference Monday afternoon at York Regional Police headquarters in Aurora, Ont., Chief Jim MacSween identified the shooter as Francesco Villi.Villi was shot and killed on the third floor, MacSween said.He said the officer who shot Villi is a 24-year-veteran of York Regional Police and &#34;he very likely saved lives by his actions last night.&#34;Meanwhile, MacSween said police could not yet identify the victims of the shooting. He said three men and two women — all residents in the condo building — were killed, and that three of those people were members of the condo board. A 66-year-old woman was also shot and remained in hospital Monday.Board members John Di Nino, who is also the president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Canada, and Tony Cutrone were not injured.

On the other hand, I was just communicating with these people 24 hours ago, and now not. It&#39;s hard to hear the words that they were killed,&#34; he said.&#34;I&#39;m still in shock. I can&#39;t believe that&#39;s the way he decided to go out and I hate that he took people with him.&#34;WATCH: York police chief gives update on mass shooting at condo building:Three men, two women killed in Vaughan, Ont. mass shooting: YRP6 months agoDuration 1:31York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween told reporters Thursday that all five victims of the shooting lived in the condo building.

Three of the five people fatally gunned down in a mass shooting at a Vaughan condo building Sunday night were members of the condo board, York Regional Police Chief Jim MacSween says.
“Three victims were members of the condominium board. But the motive for the shooting remains part of this very complicated and very fluid investigation, which is still ongoing at this time,” MacSween said.
He said three of the victims who died were men and two were women. A 66-year-old woman was also shot, but survived. She was seriously injured and remains in hospital.
MacSween confirmed the identity of the 73-year-old shooter as Francesco Villi.
TIMELINE: What we know about the Vaughan mass shooting
Multiple residents have told CP24 that the suspected gunman was involved in some sort of dispute with the condo board at the building.
Police are executing “multiple” search warrants in connection with the killings and continue to interview witnesses.
“Until that&#39;s complete, we can&#39;t rule anything out,” MacSween said. “But rest assured, detectives in the Homicide Bureau are working diligently to find the answers in this horrible incident.”
He said the officer who fatally shot the gunman is a 24-year veteran of York Regional Police and said he “very likely saved lives by his actions last night.”
All the victims were residents of the building, MacSween said, but police are not yet identifying them.
However the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), which represents 35,000 transit workers in Canada, confirmed that the wife of the group’s president, John Di Nino, was injured in the shooting. Di Nino is listed on publicly available documents as a member of the condo board.
In a brief statement, Di Nino referred to the “terrible events yesterday in Vaughan” and said that it is a “a very difficult time for my family.”
He asked for privacy and said he has no further comments for the time being.

OFFICERS ON-SCENE WITHIN MINUTES
MacSween said officers were called to the building at 9325 Jane St., just north of Rutherford Road, for an active shooter incident at 7:20 p.m. and arrived at the building within three minutes and 20 seconds to discover a “horrendous scene.”
Officers responding to the mass shooting found multiple people dead on several floors of the building before the gunman was shot dead by an officer in a hallway, Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit said in a separate update Monday.
The gunman was pronounced dead at around 8 p.m., about 40 minutes after police were called, SIU Spokesperson Kristy Denette told reporters.
“My understanding of what took place was there was multiple deceased located on several floors,” Denette said.
The shooter targeted three separate units in the building, MacSween confirmed.
“The man was a resident in the building and the man was using a semiautomatic handgun,” Denette said.
She said a single officer discharged their firearm multiple times, fatally injuring the 73-year-old gunman.
The shooter’s weapon has been recovered from the scene, but Denette could not say whether or not the gun was legally purchased.
“I don&#39;t have any information as far as any potential criminal history of the man who was killed,” Denette said.
The SIU is an arm’s length provincial agency which investigates anytime police are involved in a death, serious injury, or allegations of sexual assault.
Denette said that they are looking into the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of the gunman by police, but it will be up to York Regional Police (YRP) to provide further details about the murder of the five other individuals.
The SIU has assigned four investigators and two forensic investigators to the case. One subject officer has been designated so far.
An autopsy is set to take place Tuesday.
YRP remained at the scene Monday, including members of the force’s emergency response unit, who “conducted a thorough search of the building to ensure there are no additional victims and that it’s safe,” YRP said in a release. Forensic identification officers are also on hand.
Members of YRP’s emergency response unit were also on hand Sunday evening to assist in clearing the buildings in the residential complex.
In a tweet posted at 1:18 a.m., police said the residents of those evacuated buildings “are now able to return to their homes.”
“We thank you for your patience and understanding while we worked to ensure safety and preserve evidence,” the force said.

VAUGHAN COMMUNITY ‘IN ABSOLUTE SHOCK’
One woman who lives in the area told CP24 that she witnessed first responders performing CPR on one person at the scene and said it was “traumatizing.”
“We saw police cruisers coming in and a bunch of ambulances so we knew it was something serious,” said the woman, who identified herself as Kat. “So then I took the dog for a walk and then I walked in on a scene of a firefighter performing CPR on somebody and it was really obviously a traumatizing experience for everybody watching.
“I didn&#39;t know what was happening inside. Nobody was really saying anything but as soon as SWAT came, we knew that there was an active shooter in the building. So yeah, pretty much went home and locked our doors.”
One man who lives at the building told CP24 he spent the night elsewhere after returning home Sunday to find the building sealed off with police tape. He said he’s lived at the building for four years and “nothing” like this has happened before.
“It’s getting crazier every day, you know,” said the man, who identified himself as Abdul.
Vaughan Mayor Steven Del Duca spoke with reporters at the scene Monday and said his community is “horrified” after the mass shooting.
“It&#39;s just unspeakable to imagine that this has taken place here in our community,” Del Duca told reporters Monday morning. He said flags would fly at half-mast at all city buildings today.
He offered few details about the incident, but urged the community not to “speculate” about the tragedy.
“I would urge everyone to wait until York Regional Police has concluded their investigation and they provide their updates before we speculate,” he said.
Del Duca offered condolences to the families of the victims for the “unspeakable” incident. He said he also spoke with Chief MacSween to express his support for the officers.
“I want to thank all of our brave first responders for the work that they did yesterday to secure what I know must have been a very difficult situation,” Del Duca said.
In a tweet, Ontario Premier Doug Ford also expressed his condolences for the families of the victims.
“I’m shocked and saddened by the tragic shooting in Vaughan last night,” Ford wrote. “All of Ontario is thinking of the victims of this senseless violence and the family and friends grieving their loss. Thank you to our first responders for bravely being on scene.”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also commented on the mass killing, offering his conolences.
“To the families and friends of the victims of yesterday’s shooting in Vaughan: I’m keeping you in my thoughts. To the person who was injured: I’m wishing you a fast and full recovery,” Trudeau wrote.  “And to the first responders: Thank you for your hard work and your professionalism.”

— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) December 19, 2022
Anyone who saw what happened or anyone with photos or video surveillance, cell phone video, or dashcam footage of the shooting is being urged to contact the SIU&#39;s lead investigators at 1-800-787-8529 or https://siu.on.ca/en/appeals.php.
YRP said anyone with information about the shooting is being asked to contact the York Regional Police homicide unit at 1-288-876-5423, ext. 7865 or homicide@yrp.ca, or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS) or www.1800222tips.com.

COURT FILE NO.: CV-20-00003736
DATE: 20220804
SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE - ONTARIO
RE:                 Francesco
Villi, Plaintiff
AND:
Rita Camilleri, Dino Colalillo,
Naveed Dada, Russell Manock, John Di Nino, and Patricia De Sario, Defendants
BEFORE:      Justice
J. Di Luca
COUNSEL:   Francesco
Villi, on his own behalf
Tim Gillibrand, for the Defendants
HEARD:        July
27, 2022
ENDORSEMENT

[1]
The defendants bring a motion, pursuant to Rule
21.01(1)(b) and 21.01(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, to strike out
the statement of claim on the basis that it discloses no reasonable cause of
action and/or is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process.
The Claim and Background to the Claim
[2]
Mr. Villi is a resident in a condominium
administered by York Region Standard Condominium Corporation No. 1139 (“the
Corporation”). At the time the claim was issued on December 15, 2020, the
defendants were directors and officers of the Corporation, though this fact
cannot be discerned from the statement of claim.
[3]
The claim seeks, inter alia, payment of
$2,000,000 from all defendants jointly, damages in the amount of $2,000,000,
aggravated damages of $100,000 from each defendant, and punitive damages of
$2,000,000. While the Corporation is not a party to the action, the plaintiff
seeks an order compelling the Corporation to comply with a list of repairs
directed by the plaintiff.
[4]
The claim alleges that the defendants have
committed “Acts of Crime and Criminality” from 2010 onwards. It also alleges
that the defendants have, for their own personal gain, reasons and purposes,
“negligently purposely” caused him harm, pain, suffering, stress, damage to
physical and mental health and his financial well being.
[5]
The statement of claim also states that Mr. Villi
has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that each of the defendants has committed
criminal offences, including perjury, extortion, fraud, criminal harassment,
criminal intimidation, defamatory libel and slander. Each alleged criminal
offence is also pleaded as an offence of accessoryship and conspiracy. These
various criminal allegations are pleaded using the standard form language normally
used for criminal charges in a sworn information.
[6]
Lastly, the claim seeks damages of $250,000 from
each defendant for “abusively abusing” their power and “deliberately causing
harm, stress physically, mentally, financially, confusion inability to rest and
sleep for over 5 years, torment, torture that cannot be explain [sic] in
words.”
[7]
By way of background, in November of 2018, the
Corporation commenced an application against Mr. Villi pursuant to the Condominium
Act, 1998, seeking to restrain Mr. Villi’s allegedly threatening,
abusive, intimidating and harassing behaviour towards the Corporation’s board
of directors, property management, workers and residents of the condominium.
[8]
In June of 2019, Mr. Villi commenced an
application against the Corporation relating to issues stemming from an
electrical room beneath his unit and also relating to alleged oppressive
conduct on the part of the Corporation.
[9]
By Orders of Perell J. dated October 24, 2019,
the applications were converted into actions and consolidated into one action
to be heard in Newmarket. Perell J. also ordered Mr. Villi to refrain from
recording board members, management, residents, or employees of the
Corporation, to refrain from making social media posts about the proceedings
and to only communicate with the Corporation in writing, except in an
emergency.
[10]
On September 13, 2021, Vallee J. found Mr. Villi
in contempt of Perell J.’s Orders for communicating with staff employed by the
Corporation.
Legal Test and Related Principles
[11]
Rule 21.01(1)(b) of the Rules allows a
judge to strike a plaintiff’s pleading on the ground that it discloses no
reasonable cause of action. A pleading should only be struck where it is “plain
and obvious” that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, see Hunt v.
Carey Canada Inc., 1990 CanLII 90 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959. In other words, the moving party
must show that it is “plain, obvious and beyond doubt that the claim will not
succeed” at trial: MacKinnon v. Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement
Board, 2007 ONCA 874, 88 O.R.
(3d) 269, at para. 19 and Asghar v. Toronto Police Services Board,
2019 ONCA 479at para. 8.
[12]
This test is satisfied where a party fails to
plead necessary elements of a recognized cause of action or where the
allegations are legally insufficient, see Hillier and Maverick Paintball
Inc. v. Hutchens et al., 2014 ONSC 1579 at para. 39. The threshold for
sustaining a pleading is not high. In making its determination, the court gives
the statement of claim a generous reading allowing for inadequacies due to
drafting the deficiencies. The court also assumes that the facts pleaded are
true unless they are patently ridiculous or incapable of proof, see Lysko v.
Braley (2006), 2006 CanLII 11846 (ON CA), 79 O.R. (3d) 721 at para. 3 (Ont.C.A.).
[13]
Under Rule 21.03(d), a defendant may move to
have an action stayed or dismissed where the action is frivolous or vexatious,
or is otherwise an abuse of the court’s process. The test under such a motion
is similar to the test under Rule 21.01(b). A court will only dismiss a claim
on the basis that it is frivolous or vexatious, or an abuse of the court’s
process in the clearest of cases and where it is plain and obvious that the
claim cannot succeed, see Baradaran v. Alexanian, 2016 ONCA 533 at para.
15, and Miguna v. Toronto Police Services Board, 2008 ONCA 799 at paras.
16 and 21.
[14]
In terms of the rules of pleadings, I am guided
by the helpful comments of Perell J. in Stedfasts Inc. v. Dynacare
Laboratories, 2020 ONSC 8008 at paras. 29-36.

No evidence is admissible on a motion brought
under Rule 21.01(1)(b), though evidence is admissible in relation to a motion
under Rule 21.01(3)(d), see Miguna at paras. 15-16.
[16]
In many cases, when a pleading is struck, leave
to amend the pleading is also granted. The principles that apply in determining
whether leave to amend should be granted are set out in Spar Roofing
&amp; Metal Supplies Ltd. v. Glynn, 2016 ONCA 296, 348
O.A.C. 330, at paras. 35-45. Leave to amend
should, accordingly, be denied only in the clearest of cases: South
Holly Holdings Limited v. The Toronto-Dominion Bank, 2007 ONCA 456, at
para. 6; and Tran v.
University of Western Ontario, 2015 ONCA 295, at
para. 26.
Law and Analysis
[17]
In the course of his submissions, Mr. Villi
spoke at length about the nature of the claim he seeks to advance. As I
understand it, Mr. Villi believes that the electrical room which sits beneath
his unit is improperly constructed, resulting in the emission of
electromagnetic waves which have caused him significant pain and suffering over
the years. Mr. Villi believes that the board members of the Corporation have
actively engaged in efforts to intentionally harm him, likely at the behest of
the powerful developer who built the condominium. Mr. Villi believes that all
the individuals involved have not only conspired to harm him but have also
conspired to ensure that the truth of the matter never surfaces.
[18]
In examining the statement of claim, I note that
it is drafted by a lay person and as such, it is not surprising that it does
not set out the various claims with the degree of precision expected from
counsel. The statement of claim reveals no basis connecting the defendants to
the alleged acts. It simply alleges a number of criminal offences against a
number of individuals. Indeed, the bulk of the statement of claim is
essentially a criminal information.[1]
In other words, it is simply a list of “charges” against the defendants.
As well, to the extent that some of the “charges” might also give rise to parallel
civil causes of action, no material facts are pleaded. Lastly, even where the
claim appears to advance civil claims, it again fails to relate any material
facts in support of the claims. This is particularly problematic as the claims
seek aggravated and punitive damages for, inter alia, fraudulent and
malicious conduct.
[19]
Ultimately, I conclude that the statement of
claim is, on its face, fatally flawed. It is plain and obvious that it cannot
succeed and therefore must be struck. I would also find that the claim is
frivolous and/or vexatious as there is a complete absence of material facts
pleaded in support of any of the claims raised. In view of these findings, I
need not consider whether the claim is also an abuse of the court’s process,
though I note that the core complaint is already before the courts in the
consolidated action that is now in Newmarket by Order of Perell J.
[20]
I consider next whether leave to amend the claim
should be granted. Having listened to Mr. Villi’s submissions, I conclude that
this is not an instance where there is any prospect that, if given the
opportunity, Mr. Villi will amend the claim so as to make it even remotely
viable.  As such, I decline to grant leave to amend.
[21]
The motion is allowed. The statement of claim is
struck without leave to amend. Counsel is invited to prepare a draft order in
accordance with this endorsement. Mr. Villi’s approval of the form and content
of the order is dispensed with.
[22]
In terms of costs, the defendants seek partial
indemnity costs of approximately $10,900 all- inclusive based on full indemnity
costs of $17,973.45. Mr. Villi is opposed to any order of costs.
[23]
Having considered the costs outline in concert
with the principles that guide the determination of costs, particularly
reasonableness and proportionality, I find that the costs claimed are excessive
when viewed in context with the nature of the issues raised and the relative
simplicity of the motion and the efforts taken to date in response to the
action. Costs are fixed at $2,500 all-inclusive, payable by Mr. Villi within 30
days.



Justice J. Di Luca

Released: August 4, 2022
[1] On this issue, I note that Mr. Villi indicates that he has
attended before a Justice of the Peace in order to lay a private information
and seek issuance of process against the named individuals. While Mr. Villi
asserts that this process is unfolding in his favour, it is unclear whether
that is actually the case.
