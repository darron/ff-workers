Denis Lortie (born March 10, 1959) is a former Canadian Forces corporal. In 1984, he stormed into the Parliament Building in Quebec City and opened fire with several firearms, killing three government employees and wounding thirteen others. The National Assembly&#39;s serjeant-at-arms, René Jalbert, volunteered himself to serve as a hostage, and conversed with Lortie for several hours before convincing him to surrender to authorities.
After a 1985 conviction of first-degree murder was overturned by the Quebec Court of Appeal, Lortie pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree murder in 1987, for which he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with no parole for ten years. Lortie was granted day parole in 1995, then full parole in 1996, and has since kept a low profile among the general public.[citation needed]
Life[edit]
Denis Lortie was born in Quebec on March 10, 1959, as the youngest son of eight children. His exact birthplace within Quebec is not publicly known. Lortie and all his siblings were physically and sexually abused by their father for many years.[2]  Lortie&#39;s father reportedly fathered a child with one of his daughters.[2] One of the Lortie siblings finally informed the police of the abuses in the late 1960s. In 1969, Lortie&#39;s father was sent to federal prison for three years.[2] In 1972, Lortie&#39;s father finished incarceration but never returned to his family.[2]
Lortie joined the Canadian Forces in the late 1970s after finishing high school in Quebec. Lortie served in the Logistics Branch at CFB Borden, CFB Valcartier, CFB Halifax and CFS Carp. On December 27, 1980, Lortie married Lisa Levesque in Quebec City, and he was posted to CFB Halifax the following year.[3] The couple had a son in 1982 and a daughter in 1983.[3] At the time of the shooting, Lortie was posted to CFS Carp, near Ottawa, was ranked a corporal, and worked as a supply technician.
Lortie was bilingual in French and English. But even while speaking French, his native language, he encountered pronunciation difficulties. This resulted in irregular and halting speech.[2] Lortie blamed his social and professional failures on his inability to speak English flawlessly,[3] and was keenly aware that his poor English reinforced negative stereotypes of Francophones and Québécois.[2] After the birth of his daughter, Lortie worried that he would become abusive in the manner of his father,[3] and contemplated killing himself and his family before placing blame on the governing pro-sovereignty Parti Québécois for his problems, disliking the party&#39;s advocacy of a &#34;Francophone identity&#34; for Quebec.[3] Lortie planned the killing spree as a means of broadcasting his discontent.[3]
Events[edit]
Before the shooting[edit]
On May 7, 1984, Lortie left the CFS Carp military base, pretending that he needed time off to arrange a divorce with his wife.[3]
Lortie had previously attempted to secure leave from his base, but was refused. It was during this encounter that Lortie later claimed he saw the face of his father on the face of the officer that denied his request.[1]
He rented a car, drove to Quebec City and took a guided tour of the Parliament Building.[3] He then rented a room in a motel for the night.[3]
The next day, May 8, 1984, at 9:30 a.m., Lortie walked into CJRP radio station in Quebec City, identified himself as &#34;Mr. D&#34;, and dropped off a sealed envelope containing an audiotape for one of the station&#39;s hosts, André Arthur. He instructed the radio staff not to open the envelope until 10:30 a.m., but they opened it anyway, discovering that it was a statement of Lortie&#39;s plans, in which he declared, &#34;The government now in power is going to be destroyed.&#34;[This quote needs a citation] By the time CJRP staff contacted police, Lortie&#39;s plan was already in action.
Shooting[edit]
At 9:45 a.m., Lortie entered the Parliament Building through a side door located on Grande-Allée. He was dressed in combat uniform and armed with two C-1 submachine guns, an Inglis pistol, a duffel bag containing four hundred rounds of 9 mm NATO ammunition, as well as a knife strapped to his leg. As he entered the building, he shot and mortally wounded a receptionist, then killed a messenger whom he encountered in a corridor. He then went into a smoking room and shot and wounded a person there before moving to the cafeteria, but finally found his way into the Assembly Chamber, outside of which dozens of armed Sûreté du Québec (SQ) officers, as well as more than a dozen Groupe d&#39;intervention operatives and Quebec City Police (many carrying M2 carbines), helicopters, and snipers were taking position.[4]
Based on later testimony, it is clear that he intended to assassinate Premier René Lévesque and other members of the governing Parti Québécois. His plan was to enter the Assembly Chamber during the parliamentary committee meeting, which was starting at 10:00 a.m. that morning. Instead of watching a watch, Lortie timed his attack by listening to CJRP and waited for host André Arthur to end his segment. On that day, Arthur ended his broadcast 20 minutes early, leading Lortie to enter the building and make his way to the Assembly Chamber while it was mostly empty. He opened fire on the government employees still inside, killing one and wounding eleven.
Lortie&#39;s surrender[edit]
The National Assembly&#39;s sergeant-at-arms, René Jalbert, was informed that there was a man in military uniform with a gun in the Assembly Chamber. Upon stepping out of the elevator, Lortie asked him why he came, and fired his C-1 submachine gun inches from his face.
Jalbert said that he too had been a soldier, with the Royal 22e Régiment, and that if Lortie would allow it, he would show him his discharge card. Lortie agreed, after which Jalbert persuaded him to show his own identification.
After this exchange, Jalbert persuaded Lortie to come into his office to discuss the matter, and release the other civilians in the Assembly Chamber. Jalbert talked to Lortie for more than four hours, ultimately promising him that he would be able to surrender to military police (since he was unwilling to surrender to civilian police). At 2:15 p.m., Lortie surrendered to officers of the SQ, Quebec City Police, and the National Assembly security.[5]
For his actions, which likely prevented further death, Jalbert was awarded the Cross of Valour several months later, in the same National Assembly chamber that Lortie had burst into.
Victims[edit]
The following were killed in the shooting:
Georges Boyer
Camille Lepage (not to be confused with the French photojournalist Camille Lepage, who was also a victim of homicide)
Roger Lefrançois
Aftermath[edit]
One of the contributing factors to the shooting was, allegedly, the easy access that Lortie had to both weapons and ammunition. Unlike other non-combat Canadian Forces Bases, CFS Carp, the base at which he was stationed, apparently did not have an armoury, or even ammunition lockers.
According to psychiatrist Pierre Mailloux, who was assigned to the case, Lortie had paranoid schizophrenia and had organized his crime during a psychotic episode, believing that he was acting on instructions given to him from God. Nevertheless, in 1985, Lortie was convicted of first-degree murder, but a new trial was ordered when the Quebec Court of Appeal determined the trial judge had made errors while instructing jurors about how they should weigh testimony from psychiatrists heard in the case.
Lortie pleaded guilty to reduced charges of second-degree murder in 1987.[6]
In 1995, Lortie was released on day parole to a halfway house in Hull, Quebec, after being released from a minimum security correctional facility north of Montreal where he had been undergoing psychiatric treatment, classes to deal with aggression, and serving a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 10 years. According to the Parole Board of Canada, Lortie no longer posed a threat to society, and &#34;patched his life together despite being responsible for one of the most notorious events in Quebec history.&#34;[citation needed]
Under the release terms, Lortie was required to spend every night at the halfway house between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. He was also required to let parole board supervisors know where he was at all times, and was restricted to a 40-kilometre (25 mi) radius from the house. The relatives of some of Lortie&#39;s victims believed he was not punished severely enough, with some believing he should have been executed, a punishment that could not be applied, as Canada abolished its death penalty in 1976.[7]
Granted full parole in July 1996 (the same year Jalbert died of cancer), Lortie has since kept a low profile.[citation needed] He is last known to have worked at a convenience store in the Hull—Aylmer district of Quebec,[8] and is now married, with a steady job and a house, and has reportedly been forthcoming with &#34;the people who monitor his case&#34;.[6]

The Lennoxville massacre, or Lennoxville purge, was a mass murder which took place at the Hells Angels clubhouse in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, on March 24, 1985. Five members of the Hells Angels North Chapter, founded by Laurent &#34;L&#39;Anglais&#34; Viau and Yves &#34;Apache&#34; Trudeau, were shot dead. This event divided rival outlaw motorcycle gangs in Quebec, leading to the formation of the Rock Machine club in 1986, a rival to the Angels in the 1990s.[1] The name &#34;Lennoxville massacre&#34; is a misnomer since the killings took place in Sherbrooke. The misconception that the killings took place in Lennoxville arose from the fact the victims had stayed and partied at a motel in Lennoxville before they went to the Sherbrooke clubhouse.[2]
Background[edit]
Beginning in the 1960s, one of Montreal&#39;s more prominent biker gangs were the Popeyes Motorcycle Club, who were led by Yves &#34;Le Boss&#34; Buteau.[3] In the 1970s, the Popeyes had successfully fought against the Devils Diciples and Satan&#39;s Choice biker gangs, and as the journalist Patrick Lejtenyi noted: &#34;The violence that ensued cemented Quebec&#39;s reputation as one of the most dangerous places for organized crime to do business in North America.&#34;[3] Journalist James Dubro told Lejtenyi: &#34;There&#39;s always has been more violence in Quebec. In the biker world it&#39;s known as the Red Zone. I remember an Outlaws hit man telling me he was scared of going to Montreal.&#34;[3] The Hells Angels, who had been looking to expand into Canada, decided that the Popeyes were the best gang to take into their organization.[3] On December 5, 1977, the Popeyes &#34;patched over&#34; to become the first Hells Angel chapter in Canada.[3]
In September 1979, as the Hells Angels continued to grow, the Montreal chapter was divided into two: Montreal North and Montreal South with Yves &#34;Le Boss&#34; Buteau as the national president.[3] Confusingly, the North chapter was based in Laval (north of Montreal) while the South chapter was based in Sorel (northeast of Montreal). The North chapter, led by Laurent &#34;L&#39;Anglais&#34; Viau,, consisted mostly of former Popeyes members and still retained Popeye attitudes, in marked contrast to the South chapter headed by Réjean &#34;Zig Zig&#34; Lessard, which was more disciplined.[4] Lessard had joined the Angels in 1979, and did not have the Popeye mentality.
Longueuil restaurant
On September 8, 1983, Buteau and another Angel, René Lamoureaux, were having lunch at a Longueuil restaurant, Le Petit Bourg, with Guy &#34;Frenchie&#34; Gilbert, the president of the Kitchener, Ontario, chapter of the Satan&#39;s Choice biker gang, who was considering &#34;patching over&#34; to join the Angels.[5] As the three bikers were leaving the restaurant, a member of the Outlaws, Gino Goudreau, opened fire, killing Buteau and Gilbert while wounding Lamoureaux.[5] Goudreau was a prospect with the Outlaws and believed he would be rewarded with &#34;full patch&#34; status if he could assassinate the leader of the Canadian Hells Angels.[5]
After Buteau&#39;s assassination, Michel &#34;Sky&#34; Langlois became the president of the Angels while Lessard continued to lead the South chapter.[5] In a division of labour, Langlois focused his efforts into expanding into the rest of Canada while Lessard had effective operational control of the Angels in Quebec.[6] Laurent &#34;L&#39;Anglais&#34; Viau had a more tolerant attitude towards violence and drug use than his predecessor.[4] The North chapter, which had often chafed at and had broken Buteau&#39;s rules about not using drugs, quickly spun out of control under Viau&#39;s leadership as Viau himself abused cocaine and alcohol.[4]
Event[edit]
Other Hells Angels soon regarded the North chapter as too wild and uncontrollable, often using drugs they were supposed to sell and allegedly skimming drug profits – at least C$60,000 – that were meant for other chapters.[7] The North chapter&#39;s gratuitous aggression also frequently led them to being arrested for minor offenses, which put the entire Hells Angels operation in Quebec at risk.[7] André Cédilot, the crime reporter with La Presse newspaper, told Pierre Obendrauf of the Montreal Gazette: &#34;At that moment [in 1985], the Hells Angels were doing a cleanup to become a real criminal organization. Before that, they were disorganized and unruly. They were like a street gang ... The [Laval] guys weren&#39;t following the steps the others were taking. They fit the traditional image of bikers ... It was going against the new philosophy of the Hells Angels. The other Hells Angels wanted to be businessmen.&#34;[8] Other organized crime groups that the Hells Angels did business with, such as the Rizzuto crime family and the West End Gang, had been pressuring the Angels to bring the North chapter under control.[8] The Hells Angels assassin Yves &#34;Apache&#34; Trudeau later testified for the Crown that relations between the North and South chapters were &#34;ice cold&#34; by the beginning of 1985.[3]
When the leader of the Hells Angels&#39; Halifax chapter, David &#34;Wolf&#34; Carroll, paid Trudeau C$98,000 dollars for killing someone, he learned that the North chapter was actually entitled to one-quarter of the money, and that Trudeau had instead used the money to support his cocaine addiction.[7] As the Halifax chapter was poorer than the North chapter, Trudeau&#39;s behavior was considered to be especially crass.[7] Carroll went to Montreal to meet with Lessard, and demanded that he take action against the North chapter.[7] Lessard needed little encouragement from Carroll and spent most of the meeting railing against the North chapter, which he called a menace to the existence of the Angels in Quebec.[9] Also attending the meeting was Georges &#34;Bo-Boy&#34; Beaulieu, the president of the Angels&#39; Sherbrooke chapter,[10] who agreed with Lessard and Carroll that the North chapter needed to be liquidated.[11]
In March 1985, at a secret meeting in Sorel, the Montreal North chapter were declared to be in &#34;bad standing&#34; with the Hells Angels and were hence to be killed.[3] The plan devised by Lessard, Carroll and Beaulieu called for two members of the North chapter to be forced into retirement, another two members to be given a chance to join the South chapter and the rest to all be killed.[9] Lessard and Carroll in particular wanted Viau and Trudeau dead.[9] Robert &#34;Ti-Maigre&#34; Richard, the sergeant-at-arms of the South chapter, announced that a party would be held at the Sherbrooke chapter clubhouse on Saturday, March 23, to be attended by the Sorel, Laval, Halifax and Sherbrooke chapters, which were all of the Angels&#39; chapters in eastern Canada at the time.[9] Four other Angels chapters, all in British Columbia, did not attend the party.[9]
Lessard had planned to ambush the North chapter as they entered the clubhouse, but the plan failed when most of the targets failed to show up.[9] Lessard now extended the party for a second day, and announced that participation at the party was mandatory.[9] Most of the North chapter now appeared with the notable exceptions of Trudeau, who was undergoing drug rehabilitation in Oka, and Michel &#34;Jinx&#34; Genest, who was in the hospital recovering from a failed assassination attempt by the Outlaws.[9] Viau and four of North chapter members – Jean-Guy &#34;Brutus&#34; Geoffrion, Jean-Pierre &#34;Matt le Crosseur&#34; Mathieu, Michel &#34;Willie&#34; Mayrand,[12] and Guy-Louis &#34;Chop&#34; Adam – attended. The five men were ambushed when they arrived. Lessard, with 41 men under his command, forced them into the center of a room in the clubhouse, where they were shot dead.[9]
Aftermath[edit]
Hells Angels[edit]
Three members of the North chapter in attendance at the party who were not attacked - Gilles &#34;Le Nez&#34; Lachance, Richard &#34;Bert&#34; Mayrand, and Yvon &#34;Le Père&#34; Bilodeau - were ordered to remove the bodies and wash away the blood.[9] Lessard then told Mayrand and Bilodeau that he was fond of them, and so he was giving them the option to retire from organized crime permanently or else be killed, while Lachance was offered membership in the South chapter, which he accepted.[13]
Together with Jacques &#34;La Pelle&#34; Pelletier and Robert &#34;Snake&#34; Tremblay of the South chapter, Lachance went to see Genest to inform him that he could either join the South chapter or be killed; he chose the former.[13] To confirm his loyalty to the new order, Genest killed Claude &#34;Coco&#34; Roy, a prospect with the North chapter who was considered to be close to the murdered men, and handed over to the South chapter five bags of cocaine that Roy had with him.[13] Over the next few days, the Laval clubhouse was looted of all the money and drugs stored in it, together with six Harley-Davidson motorcycles.[13] Despite the original plan to kill Trudeau at the Sherbrooke clubhouse, he was instead contacted in rehab to be told he had been expelled from the Angels, but that he could rejoin if he killed three people whom Lessard wanted dead.[13] One of these people was Ginette &#34;La Jument&#34; Henri, the accountant to the North chapter and Mathieu&#39;s girlfriend.[13]
Quebec biker War[edit]
Main article: Quebec Biker War
The massacre was considered extreme even for the criminal underworld, and it gave the Hells Angels a notorious reputation in Quebec. Salvatore Cazzetta found the event an unforgivable breach of the outlaw code and, rather than joining the Angels, he and his brother Giovanni formed their own smaller gang, the Rock Machine, in 1986.[1]
Maurice Boucher, future Quebec Nomad chapter president, did not share Cazzetta&#39;s concerns, and after finishing a 40-month sentence for armed sexual assault on a 16-year-old girl, he joined the Hells Angels in 1986 and began to rise through the ranks. The Angels and the Rock Machine co-existed peacefully for several years, which police believed was due to Boucher&#39;s respect for the Cazzetta brothers, who were well connected to the Rizzuto crime family, and were the only criminal group the bikers were unwilling to attack. In 1994, Salvatore Cazzetta was arrested at a pit-bull farm for attempting to import eleven tons of cocaine. Boucher began to increase pressure on the Rock Machine shortly after the arrest, initiating the Quebec Biker War.[1]
Police investigation[edit]
In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, police noted changes at the North chapter compound. Pierre de Champlain, a former RCMP officer and a specialist on biker crime, told journalist Patrick Lejtenyi: &#34;They [the police] noticed that the Laval chapter&#39;s garage that served as their bunker was closed. The girlfriends of the guys who&#39;d disappeared were approached and asked, &#39;Have you seen your boyfriend lately?&#39; and things like that. Then they realized that these people had disappeared, but they didn&#39;t know they were dead.&#34;[3] In June 1985, a fisherman on the St. Lawrence River caught part of the decomposing body of Geoffrion and alerted the police.[13] At the bottom of the river, police divers located the decomposing bodies of all five victims, wrapped in sleeping bags and tied to weightlifting plates.[1] Also found was the skeleton of Berthe Desjardins, who had been missing since February 1980; Desjardins was the wife of a Hells Angel liquidated by Trudeau as a possible police informer, and was herself killed to ensure her silence.[3]
Crown witnesses[edit]
External image There was much controversy when co-founder of the Hells Angels North Chapter Yves &#34;Apache&#34; Trudeau received a lenient sentence of 7 years for the murder of 43 people.
Gilles Lachance, who was profoundly troubled by the massacre, contacted the Sûreté du Québec to state his willingness to work as an informer and to wear a wire.[2] Gerry &#34;Le Chat&#34; Coulombe, a prospect with the South chapter, was also troubled by the massacre and also agreed to turn informer for the Sûreté du Québec.[2] In exchange for his life, Trudeau was offered a deal by the South chapter to kill three other people associated with the North chapter.[3] Trudeau carried out one killing, but was arrested for possession of illegal weapons in July 1985.[3] Realizing that he would likely be killed while in prison, Trudeau cut a plea deal with the Crown, where for testifying against the Hells Angels leadership in Quebec, the Crown would treat the 43 murders he committed between 1970-1985 as manslaughter, for which he would serve just seven years.[3] As result of Trudeau&#39;s testimony, 90 murders were solved and nineteen Hells Angels members were convicted.[3] Given that Trudeau had committed 43 murders, first as a Popeye and then as a Hells Angel, his lenient sentence attracted much controversy.[3]
Convictions, sentencing and parole[edit]
Several members of the Hells Angels were present and played a role in the slaughter, but only four – Jacques Pelletier, Luc &#34;Sam&#34; Michaud, Réjean &#34;Zig-Zag&#34; Lessard and later Robert &#34;Snake&#34; Tremblay – were convicted of first-degree murder. The others were convicted of lesser related crimes.
One of the Angels present at the massacre, Richard &#34;Bert&#34; Mayrand, who was the older brother of victim Michel &#34;Willie&#34; Mayrand, refused the Crown&#39;s offer to testify against his brother&#39;s killers, saying the Angels were his family and he would never betray his &#34;brothers&#34; who had killed his biological brother.[14] Mayrand later returned to the Angels and served as one of Boucher&#39;s lieutenants during the Quebec Biker War.[15] David &#34;Wolf&#34; Carroll, the leader of the Halifax chapter of the Angels who at the very least was present at the massacre, was charged with first-degree murder but was acquitted in 1987.[16] Carroll moved to Montreal in 1990 and later played a very prominent role in the Quebec Biker War.[16] He fled Canada in March 2001 to escape an arrest warrant and has disappeared.
Pelletier, Michaud, Lessard and Tremblay were given life sentences for the murders with no chance of parole before 25 years. They were all granted parole nonetheless on the faint hope clause and ended up serving between 17 and 22 years each. Robert &#34;Ti-Maigre&#34; Richard, who issued the invitations to the massacre, was acquitted of all charges and died of a heart attack at his home in 1996. Michaud was released on full parole in June 2005. Pelletier were granted day parole in October 2008.[17]
Of the men convicted of the massacre:
Robert &#34;Snake&#34; Tremblay was granted full parole on August 30, 2004 and is living in Montreal.[8] Tremblay told the parole board: &#34;I sincerely deplore having taken the life of another person. I am very aware that I have to watch out for who I associate with and that I have everything to lose if I return to the criminal world.&#34;[8]
Luc &#34;Sam&#34; Michaud was granted full parole on May 6, 2005. Though he denied killing anyone, he stated his regret for his involvement in a crime that put him in prison for 20 years.[8] Michaud, described as a zealous Hells Angel at the time of his conviction, returned to Roman Catholicism while in prison and was expelled from the Angels in 1993.[18]
Réjean &#34;Zig Zag&#34; Lessard, the leader of the plot behind the massacre, converted to Buddhism while in prison and left the Angels in 1989.[8] Lessard was granted day parole on February 3, 2006 and told the National Parole Board that he had become a vegetarian, a pacifist, and a Buddhist, saying: &#34;You can&#39;t be a Buddhist and be in that milieu.&#34;[19] Lessard was granted full parole on August 11, 2010 and is living in Montreal.[8]
Jacques Pelletier was granted full parole on May 6, 2013. He was sent back to prison in 2014 after he violated the terms of his parole by associating with Hells Angels.[8]

Location of the explosion
Air India Flight 182 was an Air India flight operating on the Montreal–London–Delhi–Bombay route. On 23 June 1985, it was operated using Boeing 747-237B registered VT-EFO. It disintegrated in mid-air en route from Montreal to London, at an altitude of 31,000 feet (9,400 m) over the Atlantic Ocean, as a result of an explosion from a bomb planted by Canadian Sikh terrorists.[1][2] The remnants of the airliner fell into the ocean approximately 190 kilometres (120 miles) off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people aboard, including 268 Canadian citizens, 27 British citizens, and 24 Indian citizens.[3] The bombing of Air India Flight 182 is the deadliest aviation incident in the history of Air India and was the world&#39;s deadliest act of aviation terrorism until the September 11 attacks in 2001.[1][4][5]
Investigators found the attack was a part of a larger transnational terrorist plot and had included two attempted plane bombings. The first bomb was meant to explode aboard Air India Flight 301, which was scheduled to take off from Narita International Airport, Japan, but it exploded before it was loaded onto the plane. This bomb detonated early, killing two baggage handlers, because perpetrators failed to take into account that Japan does not observe daylight saving time. The second bomb planted aboard Air India Flight 182 in Canada was successful. It was eventually determined that both the plot and the bombs, which had been hidden inside luggage, had originated in Canada. The plan&#39;s execution had transnational consequences and involved citizens and governments from five nation states. The Babbar Khalsa separatist group was implicated in the bombings.[6]
Although a handful of members were arrested and tried for the Air India bombing, the only person convicted was Inderjit Singh Reyat, a dual British-Canadian national and a member of the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), who pleaded guilty in 2003 to manslaughter.[7][8] He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for assembling the bombs that exploded on board Air India Flight 182 and at Narita.[9][10]
The subsequent investigation and prosecution lasted almost twenty years. This was the most expensive trial in Canadian history, costing nearly C$130 million. The Governor General-in-Council in 2006 appointed the former Supreme Court Justice John C. Major to conduct a commission of inquiry. His report, which was completed and released on 17 June 2010, concluded that a &#34;cascading series of errors&#34; by the Government of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had allowed the terrorist attack to take place.[11]
Background[edit]
Air India 182 memorial, Toronto
Memorial in Ahakista
During the 1970s, many Sikhs emigrated to western Canada for better economic opportunities.[citation needed] These included men who later became leaders and members of the Babbar Khalsa including Talwinder Singh Parmar, Ajaib Singh Bagri, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Inderjit Singh Reyat. By the 1980s, the area around Vancouver, British Columbia, had become the largest centre of Sikh population outside India.[12]
In India on 13 April 1978 a convention organised by the Sant Nirankari Mission took place at the time of the important Sikh festival of Vaisakhi, a celebration of the birth of Khalsa. The convention was led by Gurbachan Singh, leader of the Sant Nirankari Mission, and was organized in Amritsar with permission from the Akali Dal state government. The practices of the Sant Nirankari were considered heresy by the school of orthodox Sikhism expounded by Bhindranwale.[13] A procession of about 200 Sikhs led by Bhindranwale and Fauja Singh of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha (AKJ) left the Golden Temple, heading towards the Nirankari Convention.[14] In the ensuing violence, several people were killed: two of Bhindranwale&#39;s followers, eleven members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and three Nirankaris.[15]
A criminal case was filed against 62 Nirankaris who were charged by the Akali-led government in Punjab with the murder of 13 Sikhs. The case was heard in the neighbouring Haryana state, and all the accused were acquitted,[16] on the basis that they acted in self-defence. The Punjab government decided not to appeal the decision.[17] As a result of the Nirankaris receiving positive attention in the media, some orthodox Sikhs claimed this to be a conspiracy to defame the Sikh religion.[16] Bhindranwale increased his rhetoric against the perceived enemies of Sikhs. A letter of authority was issued by Akal Takht to ostracize the Sant Nirankaris and created an environment where some of his followers felt justified to kill the perceived enemies of Sikhism.[18] The chief proponents of this attitude were the Babbar Khalsa founded by the widow, Bibi Amarjit Kaur of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha; the Damdami Taksal led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who had also been in Amritsar on the day of the attack on the convention; the Dal Khalsa, formed with the object of demanding a sovereign Sikh state; and the All India Sikh Students Federation, which was banned by the government.
The founders of this Panthan group (sect) in Vancouver vowed to avenge the deaths of Sikhs. Talwinder Singh Parmar led the militant wing of AKJ, which became the Babbar Khalsa, to attack the Nirankaris. On 24 April 1980 Gurbachan Singh, the Baba (head) of the Nirankaris, was killed. A member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Ranjit Singh, surrendered and admitted to the assassination three years later, and was sentenced to serve thirteen years at the Tihar Jail in Delhi.[19][20]
On 19 November 1981, Parmar was among the alleged terrorists who escaped from a shootout in which two Punjab Police officers were gunned down outside the house of Amarjit Singh Nihang in Ludhiana district. This added to the notoriety of Babbar Khalsa and its leader. He went to Canada.[21] In 1982, India issued a warrant for Parmar&#39;s arrest for six charges of murder, stemming from the killing of the police officers.[22] India notified Canada that Parmar was a wanted terrorist in 1981 and asked for his extradition in 1982. Canada denied the request in July 1982.[23]
After an Interpol alert, Parmar was arrested while attempting to enter West Germany. West Germany chose to handle the case locally rather than transfer him over to India. Parmar went on a hunger strike to win his religious right to wear a turban and have vegetarian meals in the Düsseldorf jail. After India received information that Parmar had made assassination threats against Indira Gandhi, they found that Germany had decided that the evidence was weak.[24]
In 1983, rebels led by Damdami Taksal Jathedar (leader) Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale occupied Akal Takht of Golden Temple and amassed weapons in the Sikh temple. They passed the Anandpur Sahib Resolution, which demanded that the state be given more powers from the Central government, and greater autonomy, by changes to the Indian constitution.[25][26] The total number of deaths was 410 in violent incidents and riots while 1,180 people were injured.[27] The Central government rejected the secessionist demands and on 3–6 June 1984, Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi ordered Operation Blue Star, to remove the militants from the Golden Temple.[28] Sikhs protested against the operation worldwide. On 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards. In retaliation, the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, guided by certain Indian National Congress members, killed thousands of Sikhs in India.[29]
Preparation[edit]
Parmar visited Inderjit Singh Reyat, an auto mechanic and electrician who lived in Duncan, British Columbia, a small community north of Victoria on Vancouver Island. He asked him to construct a bomb; Reyat later claimed he had no idea for what it would be used. Reyat asked various people in the community about dynamite, saying he wanted to remove tree stumps on his property.[30] Reyat also discussed explosives with a co-worker, while expressing anger at the Indian government and Indira Gandhi in particular.[31]
Later that year, Ajaib Singh Bagri accompanied Parmar as his right-hand man in the militancy against the Indian government. Bagri worked as a forklift driver at a sawmill near the town of Kamloops. He was known as a powerful preacher in the Indo-Canadian community.[32] The pair travelled across Canada to incite Sikhs against the Indian government for conducting Operation Blue Star. They used the meetings as fundraisers for Babbar Khalsa. A former head priest in Hamilton testified that Bagri said, &#34;The Indian Government is our enemy, the same way the Hindu society is our enemy.&#34;[33] Bagri told a congregation, &#34;Get your weapons ready so we can take revenge against the Indian Government&#34;.[33]
Bagri speech[edit]
On 28 July 1984, the founding convention of the World Sikh Organization (WSO) was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The WSO&#39;s constitution was committed to diplomacy and non-violence, and it said the organisation would &#34;strive for an independent Sikh homeland by peaceful means.&#34; Although Parmar was blocked at the border (he had been put under 24-hour watch), Bagri gave an hour-long speech at the convention.
He said, &#34;until we kill 50,000 Hindus, we will not rest,&#34; before a crowd of 4,000 people; this statement was quoted against him at his later trial.[34] Bagri defended hijackers who had forced the &#39;hated&#39; Indian government into negotiations with the Sikh leadership, and was critical of Gandhian non-violence. &#34;We are to die in the battlefield, fighting, by sacrificing ourselves. To die such a death, which is the mission of the Khalsa, is our religion&#34;.[35] Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front  members and Afghan mujahideen were also invited to the rally.[36] An Afghan mujahid said, &#34;We will bring together all movements against India because India allies itself with the Soviet Union.&#34;[37] (At the time, the Soviet–Afghan War was underway, and many foreign mujahideen had gone to Afghanistan to help the Muslims.)
A professional translator testified later as a witness that Bagri&#39;s speech in Punjabi had been distorted by observers who failed to understand &#34;its context within Sikh history and literature;&#34; he denied that Bagri had urged Sikhs to take revenge against all Hindus. He conceded that Bagri was trying to &#34;inflame passions and arouse national pride&#34;.[38]
Plot preparations[edit]
In late 1984, at least two informers reported to authorities on the first abortive plot to bomb Air India Flight 182, which then flew out of Montreal&#39;s Mirabel International Airport. In August 1984, the known criminal Gerry Boudreault claimed that Talwinder Parmar showed him a suitcase stuffed with $200,000 payment if he would plant a bomb on a plane. He decided, &#34;I had done some bad things in my time, done my time in jail, but putting a bomb on a plane ... not me. I went to the police.&#34;[39] In September, in an attempt to get his sentence for theft and fraud reduced, Harmail Singh Grewal of Vancouver told the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) of the plot to bomb the flight from Montreal. Both reports were dismissed as unreliable.[39]
The moderate Sikh Ujjal Dosanjh had spoken out against violence by Sikh extremists. He was attacked in February 1985 by an assailant wielding an iron bar. His skull was broken and he required 80 stitches in his head. On 5 March 1985, three months before the bombing, the CSIS obtained a court order to place Parmar under surveillance for one year. Although the Babbar Khalsa had not yet been officially banned, the affidavit for surveillance stated, it &#34;is a Sikh terrorist group now established in Canada&#34;, it &#34;has claimed responsibility for more than forty assassinations of moderate Sikhs and other persons in the Punjab,&#34; and &#34;penned its name to threatening letters [addressed to] ... high officials in India&#34;.[23][40] The affidavit said that on 15 July 1984, Parmar urged the Coach Temple congregation of Calgary, Alberta, to &#34;unite, fight and kill&#34; to avenge the attack on the Golden Temple.[23][40]
Explosives and clocks[edit]
In April 1985, a Canadian familiar with blasting was asked by Reyat how much dynamite it would take to blow up a tree stump. Reyat asked numerous people in Duncan about explosives, and expressed the need for revenge. Reyat sought cases of dynamite and appeared willing to pay three times the normal price. He eventually confided to one acquaintance that it was not about stumps, but &#34;trouble in the old country&#34;, that he needed &#34;explosives to help my countrymen.&#34;[41] One friend declined to get him dynamite, but did lend him a 400-page manual on mining with explosives.[41]
On 8 May 1985, Reyat bought a Micronta digital automobile clock at the RadioShack store in Duncan.[42] Designed for a 12-volt automobile electrical system, it could also be powered by a 12-volt lantern battery. The 24-hour alarm activated a buzzer. Reyat returned to the store a week later to buy an electrical relay, after asking how to get the buzzer signal to power another device. Wiretappers recorded nine telephone calls in one month between Reyat and Parmar&#39;s residence in Vancouver; Reyat called either from his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island. As a result of this activity, the government added Reyat to the list of persons being monitored for terrorist activities.[43] The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003, when at first he said he did not know for what the three clocks he had bought could be used. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device to blow up a bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device. The relay could be used to trigger the detonator circuit for a blasting cap, which would provide the initial shock needed to detonate larger explosives, such as dynamite.[30][31]
Reyat later visited a television repair shop, seeking help for a partially disassembled car clock wired to a lantern battery. He claimed that he needed help so that the buzzer stayed on rather than intermittently beeping, so that it would turn on a light in his camper to wake him up. The repairman knew his friend did not own a camper. Justice J. Raymond Paris said at Reyat&#39;s 1991 trial that this was an odd use for a timer.[44]
Bomb tests[edit]
By mid-May, Reyat had gone into the woods to test a device with a 12-volt battery, cardboard cylinder, gunpowder, and some dynamite, but the device failed to work.[36] The wooded area was in proximity to Duncan and Paldi. Later, Reyat acquired between six and eight sticks of dynamite &#34;to blow up unidentified stumps if need be in the future&#34; from a Duncan well driller after visiting his house to fix a truck. He also obtained a few blasting caps days later. On 31 May 1985, Reyat brought his timer, attached to a boombox, into his shop so that his fellow employee at Duncan Auto Marine Electric could help him fix it for a friend, but he returned the radio after it did not work properly.
On 4 June, CSIS agents Larry Lowe and Lynn Macadams followed Parmar and a &#34;youthful man&#34;[45] (identified only as &#34;Mr. X&#34;, &#34;Third Man&#34; or &#34;Unknown Male&#34;) as they went from Parmar&#39;s house to the Horseshoe Bay Ferry Terminal, rode the Nanaimo-bound ferry, and visited Reyat at his home and shop at Auto Marine Electric. The three drove to a deserted bush area, where Reyat was observed taking an object into the woods. Staying out of sight, the agents, who did not bring a camera, only heard a bang which sounded like a &#34;loud gunshot&#34;.[citation needed] Later tests showed it could also have been an explosion, and later searches turned up remnants of an aluminium &#34;electrical blasting cap&#34;.[46] J.S. Warren, director-general of counter-terrorism at CSIS, would later ask on 16 July 1986 why they did not ask the police to stop and question the suspects, or search the vehicle, which might have deterred the bombing plot.[47]
The next day, Reyat purchased a large Sanyo component tuner, model FMT 611 K, at Woolworths, and left his name and telephone number on the charge slip, which was later found in a search of his home. Reyat also bought smokeless gunpowder from a sporting goods store, signing &#34;I. Reyat&#34; on the explosives log. Study of debris from the Narita explosion would eventually show the bomb had been housed inside a Sanyo tuner with a serial number matching a model sold only in British Columbia, and used a Micronta clock as a timer, which powered a relay with an Eveready 12-volt battery to trigger blasting caps to set off a high explosive consistent with sticks of dynamite,[43] all matching items purchased by Reyat. This would lead to his eventual conviction.[43] As late as 2010, Reyat admitted only to buying and assembling some parts, but denied he ever made a bomb, knew what the bomb was to be used for, who was behind any plot, or that he ever asked or knew the name of the man who he said stayed in his house for a week completing construction of the explosive device after his device failed.[48]
On 9 June 1985, a police informer in Hamilton reported that Parmar and Bagri had visited the Malton Sikh Temple, warning the faithful that &#34;it would be unsafe&#34; to fly Air India.[49] Vancouver police also monitored militants 11 days before the bombing. A leader of the International Sikh Youth Federation complained that no Indian consuls or ambassadors had yet been killed, but the response was, &#34;You will see. Something will be done in two weeks&#34;.[50]
Tickets[edit]
The suspects in the bombing used pay phones and talked in code. Translators&#39; notes of wiretapped conversations include the following exchange between Talwinder Parmar and a follower named Hardial Singh Johal on 20 June 1985, the day the tickets were purchased:
Parmar: Did you write the story?
Johal: No, I didn&#39;t.
Parmar: Do that work first.[51]
This conversation appears to be an order from Parmar to book the airline tickets.[52] It is believed that &#34;writing the story&#34; referred to purchasing the tickets; afterward, Johal phoned Parmar back and asked if he could &#34;come over and read the story he asked for&#34;, to which Parmar agreed.[53]
Moments after the wiretapped conversation, at 01:00 UTC, a man calling himself &#34;Mr. Singh&#34; made reservations for two flights on 22 June: one for &#34;Jaswant Singh&#34; to fly from Vancouver to Toronto on Canadian Pacific Air Lines (CP) Flight 086 and one for &#34;Mohinderbel Singh&#34; to fly from Vancouver to Tokyo on Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 003 and connect to Air India Flight 301 to Bangkok. At 02:20 UTC on the same day, another call changed the reservation in the name of &#34;Jaswant Singh&#34; from CP 086 to CP 060, also flying from Vancouver to Toronto. The caller further requested to be put on the waiting list for AI 181 from Toronto to Montreal and AI 182 from Montreal to Bombay. The next day, at 19:10 UTC, a man wearing a turban paid for the two tickets with $3,005 in cash at a CP ticket office in Vancouver. The names on the reservations were changed: &#34;Jaswant Singh&#34; became &#34;M. Singh&#34; and &#34;Mohinderbel Singh&#34; became &#34;L. Singh&#34;. The reservation and purchase of these tickets together would be used as evidence to link the two flights to one plot.
One telephone number left as a contact was Vancouver&#39;s Ross Street Sikh temple. The other number became one of the first leads tracked by investigators, and was traced to Hardial Singh Johal, a janitor at a Vancouver high school.[54][55] Johal was an avid follower of Talwinder Singh Parmar, and thus closely scrutinised in the investigation following the Air India bombing. He was alleged to have stored the suitcase explosives in the basement of a Vancouver school and to have purchased the tickets for the flights on which the bombs were placed. Mandip Singh Grewal recounted how he saw and recognised Johal as his school&#39;s janitor when he said goodbye to his father, one of the Flight 182 victims, at the airport on the day of the bombing.[56]
Reyat went to work on 21 June. Phone records show he called Johal at 7:17 p.m. A witness whose name was protected testified that Bagri asked to borrow her car the night before the bombing to take some suitcases to the airport, though he would not be flying with them.[57]
Aircraft[edit]

The aircraft operating the flight was a Boeing 747-237B, registered VT-EFO; and named Emperor Kanishka. The aircraft had its first flight on 30 June 1978 and was delivered to Air India in July, 1978.[58]
Bombings[edit]
On 22 June 1985, at 13:30 UTC (6:30 a.m. PDT) a man calling himself &#34;Manjit Singh&#34; (checked in as M. Singh) called to confirm his reservations on Air India Flight 181/182. He was told he was still wait-listed, and was offered alternative arrangements, which he declined. At 15:50 UTC (8:50 a.m.), M. Singh checked into a busy line of 30 people for the CP flight from Vancouver to Toronto, which was scheduled to leave at 9:18 a.m. He asked agent Jeannie Adams to check his dark brown, hard-sided Samsonite suitcase, and have it transferred to Air India Flight 181 and then to Flight 182 to India. The agent initially refused his request to inter-line the baggage since his seat from Toronto to Montreal and from Montreal to Bombay was unconfirmed. He insisted, but the agent again rebuffed him, telling him, &#34;Your ticket doesn&#39;t read that you&#39;re confirmed&#34; and &#34;we&#39;re not supposed to check your baggage through.&#34; The man said, &#34;Wait, I&#39;ll get my brother for you.&#34; As he started to walk away, she relented and agreed to accept the bag, but told him he would have to check in again with Air India in Toronto. After the mass murders, Adams would realise this deception got the bag on its way to Flight 182. The anxious man was never identified.[59][60] At 16:18 UTC (9:18 a.m.),[61] Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 to Toronto Pearson International Airport departed without Singh.[62]
Reyat would later testify that he travelled by ferry from Duncan to Vancouver that morning to work on his brother&#39;s truck. Phone records show someone called from his residence in Duncan to Johal&#39;s number at 10:50 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. later that day. Reyat was seen in the company of another East Indian man at the Auto Marine Electric store in Burnaby, near Parmar&#39;s house, between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.[citation needed] He bought two 12 volt batteries similar to the one used in the explosive device tested in the woods, and they were to fit into a special metal bracket he had brought with him.[63] Constable Clark-Marlowe later believed there was &#34;ample time for Inderjit Singh Reyat to obtain the batteries at the Auto Marine Electric limited store in Burnaby, incorporate the batteries in the assembly of an explosive device and then have the device transported in a suitcase to the Vancouver airport&#34;.[citation needed]
At 20:22 UTC (4:22 p.m. EDT), Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 arrived in Toronto twelve minutes late. Some of the passengers and baggage, including the bag M. Singh had checked in, were transferred to Air India Flight 182. In response to threats from Sikh activists, Air India had requested extra security, leading Canada to assign extra policemen in terminals in Toronto and Montreal, and all baggage was to be checked by X-ray or by hand.[64] But after the x-ray machine broke down that day, inspectors used a portable PDD-4 explosive sniffer. An Air India security officer had demonstrated that it made a loud scream when a lit match was held an inch away, and showed that it should be used around the edge of the bag being tested. Between 5:15 and 6:00, the sniffer was heard to beep at a soft-sided maroon suitcase with a zipper going all around; it beeped in a low volume near the zipper lock. But Air India was not informed since checkers were not instructed on how to react to only a short beep, so they allowed the bag to pass on its way. Later investigation would determine that the two containers that could have contained M. Singh&#39;s bag were placed close to the sensitive electronic bay of the aircraft.[65][66]
At 00:15 UTC (8: 15 p.m., 22 June) on 23 June, Air India Flight 181, a Boeing 747-237B named Emperor Kanishka, departed Toronto Pearson International Airport for Montréal–Mirabel International Airport. The aircraft was an hour and 40 minutes late because a &#34;fifth pod&#34; (a spare engine) was installed under the aircraft below the left wing to be flown to India for repairs. Some of the parts had to be stored in the rear cargo compartment. The 5th pod engine was a serviceable spare engine that had been on lease to Air Canada after one of their Boeing 747s suffered an engine failure on the way to India. That engine received a post lease inspection and was declared serviceable by Air Canada personnel.
The plane arrived in Montréal-Mirabel International Airport at 01:00 UTC (9:00 p.m., 22 June). There, it became Flight 182.[67] Flight 182 departed for London Heathrow Airport, en route to Palam International Airport, Delhi, and Sahar International Airport, Bombay. Three hundred and twenty-nine people were on board: 307 passengers and 22 crew. Captain Hanse Singh Narendra (56) served as the captain,[68] with Captain Satwinder Singh Bhinder (41) as the first officer[69] and Dara Dumasia (57) as the flight engineer.[70] Many of the passengers were going to visit family and friends.[65]
At 07:09:58 GMT (8:09:58 a.m. Irish time), the crew of the Boeing 747 &#34;squawked 2005&#34;[71] (a routine activation of its aviation transponder) as requested by Shannon Airport Air Traffic Control (ATC), then vanished from the radar screens at 07:14:01 GMT (8:14:01 a.m. Irish time). At exactly the same time, a bomb hidden in a Sanyo tuner[72] in a suitcase in the forward cargo hold exploded while the plane was at 31,000 feet (9,400 m) at 51°3.6′N 12°49′W﻿ / ﻿51.0600°N 12.817°W﻿ / 51.0600; -12.817.[73] It caused explosive decompression and the break-up of the aircraft in mid-air. The wreckage settled in 6,700 feet (2,000 m) deep water off the south-west Irish coast, 120 miles (190 km) offshore of County Cork. No &#34;mayday&#34; call was received by Shannon ATC. ATC asked aircraft in the area to try to contact Air India, to no avail. By 07:30:00 GMT, ATC had declared an emergency and requested nearby cargo ships and the Irish Naval Service vessel LÉ Aisling to look out for the aircraft.
Meanwhile, sometime before 20:22 UTC (1:22 p.m. PDT), L. Singh (also never identified) checked in for the 1:37 p.m. CP Air Flight 003 to Tokyo with one piece of luggage, which was to be transferred to Air India Flight 301 to Bangkok.[74] However, L. Singh did not board the flight.[62]
The second bag checked in by L. Singh went on Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 003 from Vancouver to Tokyo. There were no x-ray inspections of luggage on this flight.[65] Its target was Air India Flight 301, due to leave with 177 passengers and crew bound for Bangkok-Don Mueang, but 55 minutes before the Flight 182 bombing, it exploded at the terminal in Narita International Airport. Two Japanese baggage handlers were killed and four other people were injured. It appears the conspirators meant for both bombings to occur simultaneously, but they neglected to take into account that Japan does not observe daylight saving time, as Canada does.[75]
Recovery of wreckage and bodies[edit]

By 09:13 UTC, the cargo ship Laurentian Forest discovered wreckage of the aircraft and many bodies floating in the water. India&#39;s civil aviation minister announced the possibility that the plane had been destroyed by a bomb, and the cause was probably some sort of explosion.[76] Previous 747s had been damaged or destroyed on the ground, but this was the first jumbo jet downed by sabotage.[77]
The bomb killed all 22 crew and 307 passengers. Of those, 132 bodies were recovered; 197 were lost at sea. Eight bodies exhibited &#34;flail pattern&#34; injuries, indicating that they had exited the aircraft before it hit the water. This was a sign that the aircraft had broken up in mid-air. Twenty-six bodies showed signs of hypoxia (lack of oxygen). Twenty-five, mostly victims who were seated near windows, showed signs of explosive decompression. Twenty-three had signs of &#34;injuries from a vertical force&#34;. Twenty-one passengers were found with little or no clothing.[78]
One official quoted in the report stated:
&#34;All victims have been stated in the PM reports to have died of multiple injuries. Two of the dead, one infant and one child, are reported to have died of asphyxia. There is no doubt about the asphyxial death of the infant. In the case of the other child (Body No 93) there was some doubt because the findings could also be caused due to the child undergoing tumbling or spinning with the anchor point at the ankles. Three other victims undoubtedly died of drowning.&#34;[79]
Two of these drowning victims, a pregnant woman in her second trimester and her unborn son, were described by Dr. John Hogan in testimony given at a coroner&#39;s inquest convened in Cork on 17 September 1985:
&#34;The other significant findings were large amounts of frothy fluid in her mouth and nostrils, and all of the air passages and the lungs were water-logged and extremely heavy. There was water in the stomach and the uterine. The uterus contained a normal male fetus of approximately five months. The fetus was not traumatized and in my opinion death was due to drowning.&#34;[80]
Gardline Locater
Additional evidence to support a bombing was retrieved from the broken-up aircraft, which lay on the sea bed at a depth of 6,700 feet (2,000 m).[81] The British vessel Gardline Locater, equipped with sophisticated sonar, and the French cable-laying vessel Léon Thévenin, with its remotely operated underwater vehicle Scarab 1, were dispatched to locate the flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) boxes. The boxes would be difficult to find and it was imperative that the search commence quickly. By 4 July, Gardline Locator detected signals on the sea bed. On 9 July, Scarab 1 pinpointed the CVR and raised it to the surface. The next day, the FDR was also located and recovered. In 1985, the Canadian Coast Guard Ship (CCGS) John Cabot participated in the investigations, mapping the underwater wreckage of the aircraft.[82]

A casualty list was provided by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.[83][3] The victims included 268 Canadians, 27 Britons, 22 Indians, and 12 people of undetermined nationality.[84] Canadians of Indian descent made up the majority of the passengers.[85]
Between 82 and 86 passengers were children, including six infants.[86][87][88] There were 29 entire families on the plane. Two children not on board had both parents on board, resulting in them becoming orphaned. There were six sets of children of their entire families. There were 32 people not on the aircraft who had the remaining members of their families on board.[87]
Most of the victims resided in southern Ontario and were Hindus. Some of the victims were Sikhs;[89] around 35 passengers were Sikhs from Greater Montreal.[90] In terms of metropolitan areas, the Greater Toronto Area was the home of the majority of the passengers, with Greater Montreal also having the next largest number of passengers.[91] Some passengers originated from British Columbia.[92] Forty-five passengers were employees of Air India or relatives of Air India employees.[85] Notable passengers and crew included Inder Thakur, an Air India purser and former actor along with his wife and son; and Yelavarthy Nayudamma, a scientist and chemical engineer.
105 passengers boarded the flight at Mirabel Airport, while 202 passengers who travelled on Flight 182 had boarded at Toronto Pearson Airport.[93] The report stated that interlining passengers boarding Flight 181 in Toronto who became passengers on Flight 182 included ten passengers connecting from Vancouver, five passengers from Winnipeg, four passengers from Edmonton, and two passengers from Saskatoon. It stated that all of these passengers had taken flights on Air Canada,[67][73]: 31  and no interlining passengers boarded Flight 182 in Montreal.[73]: 39  In the documentary Air India 182, Renée Sarojini Saklikar stated that her aunt and uncle had taken a Canadian Pacific Air Lines flight from Vancouver to connect to Air India 182; the two were on AI182 while it was in Montreal.[94][95] The flight crew and cabin crew of Flight 182 had boarded in Toronto and commanded the segment of Flight 181 from Toronto to Montreal.[73]: 33
There were 68 persons who cleared customs in Toronto and were scheduled to re-board Flight 181 so they could travel to their final destination, Montreal. There was a practice of passengers who intended to fly to Toronto actually buying tickets to Montreal, because tickets to Montreal had a lower cost than tickets to Toronto. On the flights going to Canada, such passengers simply disembarked in Toronto and chose not to re-board the flight to Montreal. Three passengers scheduled to go onward to Montreal never re-boarded Flight 181, and so there were 65 passengers destined for Montreal who flew the Toronto-to-Montreal segment.[73]: 33
Investigations[edit]
A commemorative plaque presented to the citizens of Bantry, Ireland, by the government of Canada for the residents&#39; kindness and compassion to the families of the victims of Air India Flight 182
Within hours, Canada&#39;s Indian community was a focus of attention as victims and among hints that officials were investigating connections to the Sikh separatists who had threatened and committed acts of violence in retaliation against Hindus.[96]
In the subsequent worldwide investigations over six years, many threads of the plot were uncovered. Based on recovery of wreckage and bodies from the surface, it was decided to retrieve wreckage and recorders from the bottom of the sea. That voice and flight recorders were cut out at the same time, and damage to parts recovered from the forward cargo bay consistent with a blast, established that it was probably a bomb near the forward cargo hold that brought the plane down suddenly. The flight was also soon linked to the earlier bombing in Japan which had also originated from Vancouver; tickets for both flights had been purchased by the same person, and in both cases the planes were carrying bags without the passenger who checked them in.[97]
One of the problems the investigators thought may have been the reason of the supposed crash was that the aircraft was carrying a spare engine. Therefore, there would have been more weight on one side. This reason was ruled out as the flight recorders relayed information of the rudder position which assists in the carrying of a 5th engine. Carrying a 5th engine helped airlines carry broken engines back to be maintained.
No bomb parts were recovered from the ocean, but investigations of the blast at Tokyo established that the bomb had been placed in a Sanyo stereo tuner of a series that had been shipped to Vancouver in Canada. The RCMP assigned no less than 135 officers to check every store that could have sold Sanyo tuners, leading to the discovery of a recent sale to mechanic Inderjit Singh Reyat in his hometown of Duncan, British Columbia. RCMP contacted the CSIS and found they were already investigating the Sikh activists; RCMP learned that CSIS already had wiretaps and had observed Reyat and Parmar at the test blast near Duncan, and had recovered blasting cap shunts and a paper bundle wrapper from a blasting cap.[98] A search recovered the receipt for a Sanyo Tuner Model FMT-611K with invoice with his name and phone number, along with sales of other bomb components.[99] It was not until January 1986 that Canadian investigators at the Canadian Aviation Safety Board concluded that a bomb explosion in the forward cargo hold had downed the airliner.[100] On 26 February 1986, Supreme Court Judge Kirpal of India presented an inquiry report based on investigation conducted by H.S. Khola (the &#34;Khola Report&#34;). The report also concluded that a bomb originating in Canada brought down the Air India flight.[73]
Based on observations, wiretaps, searches and arrests of persons believed to be participants, the bombing was determined to be the joint project of at least two Sikh terrorist groups with extensive membership in Canada, the United States, Britain and India. Militant Sikhs were angered by the destruction of the Golden Temple and deaths of Sikhs during India&#39;s ground assault on separatists,[45] as well as the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.[101][102]
Suspects[edit]
The multiple suspects in the bombing were members of a Khalistani group called the Babbar Khalsa (banned in Europe and the United States as a proscribed terrorist group) and other related groups who were at the time agitating for a separate Sikh state (called Khalistan) in Punjab, India.[103]
Talwinder Singh Parmar (26 February 1944 – 15 October 1992) – a Canadian citizen born in Punjab and living in British Columbia, was a high-ranking official in the Babbar Khalsa. His phone was tapped by CSIS for three months before the bombing.[23] He was killed in an extra-judicial execution conducted by the Punjab Police on October 15, 1992 after being captured and interrogated.[104] 6 other men in police custody were killed in this fake encounter.
Inderjit Singh Reyat (born 11 March 1952) – was born in India, but moved to the United Kingdom with his family in 1965 and later to Canada in 1974, and holds dual British and Canadian citizenship. He worked as an auto mechanic and electrician in Duncan, British Columbia on Vancouver Island. Investigation of the bombing in Tokyo led to discovery that he had bought a Sanyo radio, clocks and other parts found after the blast. He was convicted of manslaughter for constructing the bomb. As part of a deal, he was to testify against others, but as he declined to implicate others, he would be the only suspect convicted in the case.[105] Reyat was released to halfway house in 2016[106] and now fully released with some restrictions since early 2017 to his family&#39;s home in BC.[107]
Ajaib Singh Bagri (born 4 October 1949) – a mill worker living in Kamloops. During the founding convention of the World Sikh Organization in New York in 1984, Bagri gave a speech in which he proclaimed that, &#34;until we kill 50,000 Hindus, we will not rest.&#34;[108] He and Ripudaman Singh Malik (4 February 1947 – 14 July 2022) were acquitted in 2005.[109] Bagri was living in Kamloops as of 2011.[110] In July 2022, Malik was murdered in a targeted attack in Surrey, British Columbia.[111]
Surjan Singh Gill (born 19 October 1942) – was living in Vancouver as the self-proclaimed consul-general of Khalistan. Some RCMP testimony claimed he was a mole who left the plot just days before its execution because he was told to pull out, but the Canadian government denied that report. He later fled Canada and was believed in August 2003 to be hiding in London, England.[112]
Hardial Singh Johal (born 20 November 1946 - 15 November 2002) – a follower of Parmar who was active in the Gurdwaras where Parmar preached. On 15 November 2002, Johal died of natural causes at age 55. His phone number was left when ordering the airline tickets, he was seen at the airport the day the luggage was loaded, and he had allegedly stored the suitcases containing the bombs in the basement of a Vancouver school, but was never charged in the case.[113]
Daljit Sandhu –  named by a Crown witness as the man who picked up the tickets. During the trial, the Crown played a video from January 1989 in which Sandhu congratulated the families of Indira Gandhi&#39;s assassins[114] and stated that &#34;she deserved that and she invited that and that&#39;s why she got it.&#34;[citation needed] Sandhu was cleared by Judge Ian Josephson in a 16 March judgment.
Lakhbir Singh Rode – the leader of the Sikh separatist organisation International Sikh Youth Federation. In September 2007, the commission investigated reports, initially disclosed in the Indian investigative news magazine Tehelka,[115] that Parmar had allegedly confessed and named the hitherto-unnamed Lakhbir Singh Rode as the mastermind behind the explosions.[116] This claim appears to be inconsistent with other evidence known to the RCMP.[117]
On 17 August 1985, Reyat became a third suspect once the receipt for the tuner was found with his name. On 6 November 1985, the RCMP raided the homes of Parmar, Reyat, Gill and Johal.[citation needed] In a 4+1⁄2-hour interview, Reyat denied all knowledge of the test blast or even Parmar. After he was told the CSIS had seen both of them, he changed his story that Parmar really wanted to build a device powerful enough so that he could take the device back to India to destroy a bridge. He explained that the gunpowder in the test was a failure, as the device fizzled. The search of Reyat&#39;s house produced a carton with an unusual green tape also found in the Narita blast and a can of Liquid Fire-brand starting fluid matching fragments found at the blast site, along with blasting caps and dynamite, including a pound of dynamite in a bag taken out its original tube casing, though none was consistent with blast residue. Reyat insisted only the clock, relays and tuner had been purchased for other than &#34;benign purposes&#34;. There was insufficient evidence to hold Parmar as charges were dropped days later.
Bagri would later state before his later trial that he knew he was probably a suspect by October 1985, but insisted he would have faced charges if there were any evidence he had anything to do with the bombing.[118] It was established by November that it was a man with a Sikh name who probably checked the bag in Vancouver that caused the crash.[100] Parmar was not seen in Canada sometime after late 1986, as authorities believed him to be living in Pakistan where he continued operations against India.
Trials[edit]
Authorities initially lacked evidence to link Inderjit Singh Reyat directly to either the Narita or Air India blasts and pursue a conspiracy to commit murder charge. Instead, Reyat pleaded guilty on 29 April 1986 to possession of an explosive substance and possession of an unregistered firearm. His sentence was a light $2,000 fine. Just three months later, Reyat moved his family from Canada to Coventry, near Birmingham, in the UK. Reyat was soon hired at a Jaguar factory where he worked for nearly two years.[119]
Mounties working with prosecutor Jardine and RCMP and Japanese experts eventually determined the components of the bomb from fragments and matched them with items that Reyat possessed or had purchased. Prosecutor Jardine visited Tokyo five times to meet with Japanese authorities, and Canada formally asked that evidence to be sent to Canada. Still lacking sufficient evidence for a murder charge, Jardine recommended two manslaughter charges and five explosives-related counts, resulting in a request to Britain to extradite Reyat, who was arrested on 5 February 1988 as he was driving to the Jaguar car plant. After lengthy proceedings to extradite him from Britain, Reyat was flown to Vancouver on 13 December 1989 and his trial began 18 September 1990. On 10 May 1991, he was convicted of two counts of manslaughter and four explosives charges relating to the Narita Airport bombing. He was sentenced to 10 years&#39; imprisonment.[120]
Fifteen years after the bombing, on 27 October 2000, RCMP arrested Malik and Bagri. They were charged with 329 counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of the people on board Air India Flight 182, conspiracy to commit murder, the attempted murder of passengers and crew on the Canadian Pacific flight at Japan&#39;s New Tokyo International Airport (now Narita International Airport), and two counts of murder of the baggage handlers at New Tokyo International Airport.[121][122] It became known as the &#34;Air India Trial&#34;.[123]
On 6 June 2001, RCMP arrested Reyat, who about to finish his earlier 10-year-sentence, on charges of murder, attempted murder, and conspiracy in the Air India bombing.[citation needed] On 10 February 2003, Reyat pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter for aiding in the construction of a bomb. He was sentenced to five years in prison.[124] The court claimed Reyat was guilty of helping make of the bomb, but that he lacked any knowledge of how it would be used and lacked an intent to kill. He was expected to provide testimony in the trial of Malik and Bagri, but prosecutors were vague.[125]
The trial of Malik and Bagri proceeded between April 2003 and December 2004 in Courtroom 20,[126] more commonly known as &#34;the Air India courtroom&#34;. At a cost of $7.2 million, the high-security courtroom was specially built for the trial in the Vancouver Law Courts.[127] On 16 March 2005, Justice Ian Josephson found the two accused not guilty on all counts because the evidence was inadequate:
I began by describing the horrific nature of these cruel acts of terrorism, acts which cry out for justice. Justice is not achieved, however, if persons are convicted on anything less than the requisite standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Despite what appear to have been the best and most earnest of efforts by the police and the Crown, the evidence has fallen markedly short of that standard.[128]
In a letter to the Attorney General of British Columbia, Malik demanded compensation from the Canadian government for wrongful prosecution in his arrest and trial. Malik owes the government $6.4 million and Bagri owes $9.7 million in legal fees.[129][130]
On July 14, 2022, Ripudaman Singh Malik, one of the men acquitted in the 1985 Air India terrorist bombings, was shot to death in Surrey, B.C.[131]
Reyat&#39;s perjury trial[edit]
In February 2006, Inderjit Singh Reyat was charged with perjury with regard to his testimony in the trial.[132] The indictment was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia and lists 27 instances in which Reyat allegedly misled the court during his testimony. Reyat had pleaded guilty to constructing the bomb, but denied under oath that he knew anything about the conspiracy.
In the verdict, Justice Josephson said:
I find him to be an unmitigated liar under oath. Even the most sympathetic of listeners could only conclude, as do I, that his evidence was patently and pathetically fabricated in an attempt to minimise his involvement in his crime to an extreme degree, while refusing to reveal relevant information he clearly possesses.&#34;[133]
On 3 July 2007, with perjury proceedings still pending, Reyat was denied parole by the National Parole Board, which concluded he was a continued risk to the public. The decision meant Reyat had to serve his full five-year sentence, which ended 9 February 2008.[134]
Reyat&#39;s perjury trial began in March 2010 in Vancouver, but was abruptly dismissed on 8 March 2010. The jury was dismissed after &#34;biased&#34; remarks about Reyat by a woman juror.[135]
A new jury was chosen. In September 2010, according to the Lethbridge Herald newspaper, jurors were told Reyat had lied 19 times under oath.[136] On 19 September 2010, Reyat was convicted of perjury.[137]
On 7 January 2011, he was sentenced to 9 years in prison by Justice Mark McEwan, who remarked that Reyat &#34;behaved nothing like a remorseful man unwittingly implicated in mass murder,&#34; adding that, &#34;[i]n the witness box, Mr. Reyat behaved like a man still committed to a cause which treated hundreds of men, women and children [as] expendable.&#34;[137][138] In February 2011, Reyat filed an appeal stating that the judge &#34;erred in law, misdirected the jury and failed to tell jurors there was no evidence to support portions of the Crown&#39;s closing address,&#34; and called it &#34;harsh and excessive,&#34; asking for a new trial.[139]
In January 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected Reyat&#39;s bid to appeal his perjury conviction. The country&#39;s top court did not disclose its reasons as per customary practice.[140]
In March 2014, the British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed Reyat&#39;s appeal that the 9-year length of the sentence, the country&#39;s longest sentence for perjury, was unfit. The court ruled the gravity of the perjury in such a case was without comparison.[141]
Parole[edit]
On 28 January 2016, Inderjit Singh Reyat was released on parole. He was released from a halfway house less than 13 months later, on 14 February 2017, with restrictions.[142][138]
Mistakes and missed opportunities[edit]
Previous warning[edit]
The Canadian government had been warned by the Indian R&amp;AW about the possibility of terrorist bombs aboard Air India flights in Canada, and over two weeks before the crash, CSIS reported to the RCMP that the potential threat to Air India as well as Indian missions in Canada was high.[46]
In June 1985, there was an Air India telex message that suggested planes could be targeted by &#34;time delay devices.&#34; Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario James Bartleman also testified that, as a senior intelligence official in the federal Department of External Affairs, he saw a security &#34;intercept&#34; with a specific warning of a threat against the airline on the weekend of the bombing.[138]
Destroyed evidence[edit]
In his verdict, Justice Ian Josephson cited &#34;unacceptable negligence&#34; by CSIS when hundreds of wiretaps of the suspects and other informants were destroyed.[143][144] Of the 210 wiretaps that were recorded during the months before and after the bombing, 156 were erased. These tapes continued to be erased even after the terrorists had become the primary suspects in the bombing.[145]
Because the original wiretap records were erased, they were inadmissible as evidence in court.[146] CSIS claimed the wiretap recordings contained no relevant information, but an RCMP memo states that &#34;There is a strong likelihood that had CSIS retained the tapes between March and August 1985, that a successful prosecution of at least some of principals in both bombings could have been undertaken.&#34;[147] &#34;The CSIS investigation was so badly bungled that there was a near mutiny by CSIS officers involved in the probe,&#34; said the agent who destroyed the tapes once he had been granted anonymity in January 2000 by Globe and Mail journalists.[144] One agent &#34;said he felt compelled to destroy the tapes (that were in his possession) because he was morally obliged to do everything in his power to protect the safety of his sources. &#39;[I] decided it was a moral issue... If their identity had become known in the Sikh community, they would have been killed. There is no doubt in my mind about that.&#39;&#34;[144]
Murdered witnesses[edit]
Tara Singh Hayer, the publisher of the Indo-Canadian Times and a member of the Order of British Columbia,[148] provided an affidavit to the RCMP in 1995 claiming that he was present during a conversation in which Bagri admitted his involvement in the bombings.[149] While at the London offices of fellow Sikh newspaper publisher Tarsem Singh Purewal, Hayer claimed he overheard a meeting between Purewal and Bagri in which Bagri stated that &#34;if everything had gone as planned the plane would have blown up at Heathrow airport with no passengers on it. But because the plane was a half-hour to three quarters of an hour late, it blew up over the ocean.&#34;[citation needed] On 24 January that same year, Purewal was killed near the offices of the Des Pardes newspaper in Southall, England, leaving Hayer as the only other witness.[150]
On 18 November 1998, Hayer was shot dead while getting out of his car in the garage of his home in Surrey, British Columbia.[151] Hayer had survived an earlier attempt on his life in 1988, but was paralysed and used a wheelchair.[151] As a consequence of his murder, the affidavit was inadmissible as evidence.[152] This was later cited as a reason why the suspects in the bombing were eventually acquitted in 2005.
CSIS connection[edit]
During an interview with Bagri on 28 October 2000, RCMP agents described Surjan Singh Gill as an agent for CSIS, saying the reason that he resigned from the Babbar Khalsa was because his CSIS handlers told him to pull out.[153]
After the subsequent failure of CSIS to stop the bombing of Flight 182, the head of CSIS was replaced by Reid Morden. In an interview for CBC Television&#39;s news program The National, Morden claimed that CSIS &#34;dropped the ball&#34; in its handling of the case. A Security Intelligence Review Committee cleared CSIS of any wrongdoing. However, that report remains secret to this day. As of June 2003, the Canadian government continued to insist that there was no mole involved.[154][155]
Public inquiry[edit]
On 1 May 2006, the Crown-in-Council, on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper,[156] announced the launch of a full public inquiry into the bombing, headed by retired Supreme Court Justice John Major, to find investigate the events surrounding the bombing and the subsequent investigation, as well as to identify gaps in Canada&#39;s security and intelligence system.[138][157][158]
Initiated later in June, the Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182 was to examine how Canadian law restricted funding terrorist groups,[159] how well witness protection is provided in terrorist cases, if Canada needed to upgrade its airport security, and if issues of co-operation between the RCMP, CSIS, and other law enforcement agencies had been resolved. It was to also provide a forum wherein families of the victims could testify on the impact of the bombing and would not repeat any criminal trials.[160]
The inquiry&#39;s findings were published on 17 June 2010 in its final report, Air India Flight 182: A Canadian Tragedy.[161] The report was 4,000 pages long, with 5 volumes and 64 recommendations.[138][158] Major concluded that a &#34;cascading series of errors&#34; by Crown ministries, the RCMP, and CSIS allowed the terrorist attack to take place.[11][162][163] He called for the Canadian government&#39;s National Security Advisor to be given responsibility for preventing conflict between agencies, as well as calling for a national director of terrorism prosecutions, a new coordinator of witness protection for terrorism cases, and broad changes to close the gaps in airport security.[138]
As per recommendation of the inquiry, Stephen Harper announced in the media, a week after the report and on the 25th anniversary of the disaster, that he would &#34;acknowledge the catastrophic failures of intelligence, policing and air security that led to the bombing, and the prosecutorial lapses that followed&#34; and deliver an apology on behalf of the sitting Cabinet of Canada.[156]
Legacy[edit]
&#34;A Canadian tragedy&#34;[edit]

On 23 June 2005, 20 years after the downing of Air India Flight 182, Prime Minister Paul Martin attended a memorial service in Ahakista, West Cork, Ireland, with victims&#39; families to grieve. This would be the first time a Canadian Prime Minister had visited the Irish memorial, which was built right after the bombing.[138] Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, on the advice of Martin, declared the anniversary a national day of mourning. During the anniversary observances, Martin said that the bombing was a Canadian problem, not a foreign problem, saying,
Make no mistake: The flight may have been Air India&#39;s, it may have taken place off the coast of Ireland, but this is a Canadian tragedy.[164]
Ujjal Dosanjh, the moderate Sikh who had been attacked in a prelude to the Air India bombing, was by this time a member of Martin&#39;s cabinet as federal Minister of Health, and had previously in the interim been Premier of British Columbia.
In May 2007, Angus Reid Strategies released the results of public opinion polling of whether Canadians viewed the Air India bombing as a Canadian or Indian tragedy and whom they blamed: 48% of respondents considered the bombing as a Canadian event, while 22% thought it was a mostly Indian affair; 34% of those asked felt both CSIS and airport security personnel deserved a great deal of the blame in addition to 27% who believed the RCMP were largely to blame; 18% mentioned Transport Canada.[165]
Ken MacQueen and John Geddes of Maclean&#39;s said that the Air India bombing has been referred to as &#34;Canada&#39;s 9/11.&#34; They disagreed, however, stating the following:
In truth, it was never close to that. The date, 23 June 1985, is not seared into the nation&#39;s soul. The events of that day snuffed out hundreds of innocent lives and altered the destinies of thousands more, but it neither shook the foundations of government, nor transformed its policies. It was not, in the main, even officially acknowledged as an act of terrorism.[166]
Memorials[edit]
Memorials were erected in Canada and elsewhere to commemorate the victims. In 1986, a monument was unveiled in Ahakista, Ireland, on the first anniversary of the bombing.[167][168]
Subsequently, a groundbreaking occurred on 11 August 2006 at a playground that would form part of a memorial in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia.[169]
Another memorial was unveiled on 22 June 2007 in Humber Bay Park East, Toronto, Ontario; many of the bombing victims had lived in Toronto. The memorial features a sundial, the base of which consists of stones from all provinces and territories of Canada, as well as the countries of the other victims, and a wall, oriented toward Ireland and bearing the names of the dead.[170]
A third Canadian memorial opened in Ottawa in 2014.[171] A fourth memorial was unveiled in Lachine, Montreal on the 26th anniversary of the tragedy.[172] There are no memorials in India as of yet.[172]
Recognition in media[edit]
In film and television:
CBC Television announced the start of filming for Flight 182, a documentary about the tragedy directed by Sturla Gunnarsson.[173][174] Its title was changed to Air India 182 before premiering at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto in April 2008. It subsequently premiered on CBC Television in June.[175]
The crash was featured in season 5 of the Canadian-made, internationally distributed documentary series Mayday, on the episode &#34;Air India: Explosive Evidence&#34;.[176]
Many journalists have commented on the bombing throughout the decades since it occurred.
In 2006, International bestselling author Anita Rau Badami published Can you hear the nightbird call?, a fiction novel that explored the lives and events leading up to the Air India bombing, which incorporated factual details of the tragedy.[177]
Eight months after the bombing, The Province newspaper reporter Salim Jiwa published Death of Air India Flight 182.[178]
Loss of Faith: How the Air-India Bombers Got Away With Murder was published by the Vancouver Sun reporter Kim Bolan in May 2005.[179]
Jiwa and fellow reporter Don Hauka published Margin of Terror: A reporter&#39;s twenty-year odyssey covering the tragedies of the Air India bombing in May 2007.
In her short story, &#34;The Management of Grief,&#34; Indian-born American writer Bharati Mukherjee uses fiction to explore the enduring grief of relatives of Air India 182 victims. &#34;The Management of Grief&#34; was originally published in the fiction collection The Middleman and Other Stories.[180] Mukherjee also co-authored The Sorrow and the Terror: The Haunting Legacy of the Air India Tragedy (1987) with her husband, Clark Blaise.[181]
Inspired by mainstream Canada&#39;s cultural denial of the Air India tragedy, Neil Bissoondath wrote The Soul of All Great Designs.[182]
In 2013, Canadian poet Renée Sarojini Saklikar created a collection of memorial and response poems, Children of Air India: Un/authorized Exhibits and Interjections.[183]
The Air India bombing is central to the plot of the novel All Inclusive by Toronto-based author Farzana Doctor.
Dr. Chandra Sankurathri, husband and father of Air India victims, wrote an autobiography called Ray of Hope.[184]
Other recognition[edit]
The Pada memorial awards at Laurentian University were established in honour of victim Vishnu Pada, the husband of Lata Pada, Indian-born Canadian choreographer and Bharatanatyam dancer.[185]
The University of Manitoba created the Donald George Lougheed Memorial Scholarship in honour of Air India victim Donald George Lougheed. It is awarded to computer engineering students.[186]
Laxminarayan and Padmini Turlapati, the parents of victims Sanjay and Deepak Turlapati, created the Sanjay Deepak Children Trust.[88]
Sankurathri Foundation was established by Dr. Chandra Sekhar Sankurathri[187] in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh in memory of his wife Manjari, son Sri Kiran and daughter Sarada, victims of the Air India Flight 182. SF implements educational programs through Sarada Vidyalayam, health care programs through Sri Kiran Institute of Ophthalmology and disaster relief programs through Spandana.

Raymond Russell Rafuse Murdered Four at a 1988 Calgary Party
Published July 29, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.

Everyone was having a good time at a Calgary basement suite party on July 29, 1988, until Raymond Russell Rafuse got into an argument with Donald Clarke. The cause?  Rafuse made a pass at Betty Jean Schoenhalz, Clarke’s girlfriend, and he didn’t take kindly to it.
Within minutes Clarke was dead, Schoenhalz lay bleeding on the stairs, in agony, with two bullets in her back.
Rafuse only shot her, he told Schoenhalz, because she tried to run away. Then Rafuse kissed and fondled her while he cried about how sorry he was because he really liked her. She played along in the hopes he would not kill her. It worked.
When the first gunshots rang out, Russell Rafuse’s older brother Norman grabbed 14-year-old Gary Charette and dragged him outside to safety.
The distraught boy wanted to see if his mother was okay. When Russell Rafuse left the basement suite to get more bullets for his gun the boy ran back inside to find his mother.  Rafuse returned, shot him, then killed his mother, Laura Charette, and Elwin Nugent as they lay sleeping in the bedroom.
Within 20 minutes, four people were dead: Donald Clarke, Elwin Nugent, Laura Charette, her 14-year-old son Gary.
All four murder victims were found with their pants undone, their throats slashed, then stuffed a cigarette butt in Donald Clarke’s left ear, a wash cloth in Elwin Nugent’s mouth and a rose into Laura Charette’s vagina.
One lucky soul, Susan Daniels, escaped unharmed after convincing the killer’s brother, Norman, she wanted to buy more beer at the convenience store. When she reached the store she called the police.

Police Arrive
When police entered the basement suite where Russel Rafuse killed four people he was calm, co-operative and alert, Calgary Police Service Constable Bradford McNish testified.
“I asked him, ‘What are you doing here?” McNish told the court.
“He replied, ‘I’m here to party, or I’m here at the party.’”
“I was surprised at the calmness he was taking this with,” said Sgt. Lorne Ferguson, who read Rafuse his rights and placed him under arrest for murder.
McNish also testified he found a small, terrified child curled up in a fetal position under blankets in the basement where four people were killed. The child, 5-year-old Elwin Nugent Jr., suffered immense mental and emotional trauma as a result of witnessing the murder of his father.

Denial
“I have no recollection of any shooting taking place,” Rafuse testified. “As far as I know in my mind I’ve never killed anybody, I’ve never shot anybody, I’ve never stabbed anybody… [but] I accept full responsibility for everything.”
Hilda, Raymond Rafuse’s mother, said her son often blanked out as a teenager.
“I called it his dead look,” she said, adding it was usually followed by rage-filled outbursts.
When Raymond Rafuse got “the dead look” people got hurt.

Closing Arguments
“In the administration of criminal justice we see the dark side of humanity,” Crown prosecutor Peter Martin said during his closing arguments.
“Man’s inhumanity to man is limited only by his imagination. This man [Russel Rafuse] has his dark side. This man is violent. This man is just able to contain himself most of the time.
“He gave way to that dark side,” Martin said, when he shot, stabbed and defiled the bodies of four people during a drinking party. This was precision killing. He carefully executed four people. He spared his brother and a child.”

The Verdict
“This is a man who enjoys violence,” Justice Allen Sulatycky said. “When he drinks or uses drugs, he becomes uninhibited and his real nature emerges.”
After ruling Rafuse had the requisite intent to kill, Justice Sulatycky said the additional element required to prove first-degree murder, planning and deliberation, were only present in two of the four senseless killings.
Justice Sulatycky ruled Elwin Nugent and Laura Charette were first-degree murder. Both were killed while sleeping in a bedroom several minutes after he shot Clarke and after he returned from his neighbouring suite to get more bullets and a knife.
On Wednesday, October 25, 1989, Justice Sulatycky sentenced Raymond Russell Rafuse to life in prison with no parole for at least 25 years.
“It’s a good thing I didn’t bet,” said a smiling Russell Rafuse. “I would have lost.”

Appeal Dismissed
On December 1, 1992, the Alberta Court of Appeal dismissed Raymond Rafuse’s appeal of his conviction for first-degree murder of Donald Clarke and Laura Charette and his conviction for second-degree murder of Gary Charette and Elwin Nugent.

Russell Raffuse Killed Before
On September 25, 1977, the body of Virginia Alice Sjoberg was found in her Burnaby, BC, apartment.
Prior to her death, she suffered multiple bruises on her forehead, cheek, ear, back, and both legs.
Virginia Sjoberg sustained 19 stab wounds, two of which pierced her heart and killed her. The killer left the murder weapon lodged in Virginia’s right eye socket with the blade buried deep in her brain.
Raymond Russell Rafuse, then 20 years old, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder for her death.
“I got slapped one minute and the next minute I was standing there and she was on the floor dead,” he said in court.
Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, Rafuse blamed Virginia Sjoberg for mocking his inability to get an erection because he was so drunk.
On October 18, 1978, a BC Supreme Court jury sentenced Raymond Russell Rafuse to life in prison for the murder of Virginia Alice Sjoberg, who was his older brother’s girlfriend.
He appealed the 1978 decision, won a new trial, and was convicted of manslaughter in 1980. He served four years of a six-year sentence, according to the Vancouver Sun, and was paroled in December, 1984, and was still on parole when he committed the Calgary murders.
Fraser Simons, BC Regional Director for the National Parole Board, wrote to correct the Sun’s report.
“Raymond Rafuse was not on parole when he committed four murders in Calgary. He was never granted parole during his six-year manslaughter term. He completed his sentence in November, 1986 – 20 months before the Calgary murders.
“The National Parole Board is prepared to be held accountable for the rare cases where a parolee re-offends in a tragic way. This is not one of those cases.”

Lack of Memory or Lack of Remorse?
“This thing [murdering more innocent people] could happen again tomorrow. I don’t have any control. There’s no button I can push. The potential’s always there,” Rafuse said.  “Why did I kill these people? It’s like I said, as far as I’m concerned I didn’t.”
Henry Sarava, Refuse’s lawyer during his trial, appeal and retrial for the 1977 murder of Virginia Alice Sjoberg, his older brother’s girlfriend, is convinced Refuse should have been sent to a mental institution, not prison.
Had the insanity plea been accepted after his first murder, Russel Rafuse would have been sent to a psychiatric institution.
“If treatment had been successful, he might well not have killed the four people in Calgary,” Sarava said.
Norman Rafuse – the Killer’s Older Brother
Norman Rafuse removed two garbage bags from the basement suite where Russel Rafuse shot and stabbed four people to death on July 29, 1989.
Evidence at Russell Rafuse’s trial said Norman watched his brother slit the throats of his victims, then cleaned up evidence at the murder scene.
When his defence attorney attempted to argue Norman Rafuse was drunk at the time, Crown prosecutor Les Grieve made a single point to refute the drunk excuse.
“His reaction is not to aid the injured or the dying, but to help his brother.”
Grieve went on to say that while he was drinking, his actions showed he had the capacity to the form intent to help his brother cover up his crimes.
On Thursday, November 16, 1989, Justice John Waite sentenced Norman Rafuse to two and a half years in prison for being an accessory after the fact to the murders committed by his brother.

Canadian mass murderer (1964–1989)
Marc LépineMarc Lépine in 1989BornGamil Rodrigue Liass GharbiOctober 26, 1964Montreal, Quebec, CanadaDiedDecember 6, 1989(1989-12-06) (aged 25)Montreal, Quebec, CanadaCause of deathSuicide by gunshotMotiveAntifeminism, misogynyDetailsDateDecember 6, 1989Location(s)Montreal, Quebec, CanadaTarget(s)École Polytechnique de MontréalKilled15 (including himself)Injured14 (including Nathalie Provost)WeaponsRuger Mini-14  Hunting knife
Marc Lépine  (French: [maʁk lepin]; born October 26, 1964 – December 6, 1989) was a Canadian antifeminist mass murderer from Montreal, Quebec, who, in 1989, murdered fourteen women, and wounded ten women and four men[note 1] at the École Polytechnique de Montréal, an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, in the École Polytechnique massacre.[1][2]
Lépine was born in Montreal, the son of Canadian nurse Monique Lépine and Algerian businessman Rachid Gharbi. Gharbi was abusive towards and contemptuous of women, and left the relationship after Monique returned to nursing to support her children; Lépine was seven at the time. Lépine and his younger sister lived with other families, seeing their mother on weekends. Lépine was considered bright but withdrawn, and had difficulties with peer and family relationships. He legally changed his name at the age of 14 giving &#34;hatred of his father&#34; as the reason.
Lépine&#39;s application to the Canadian Forces was rejected, and in 1982 he began a science program at a college, switching to a more technical program after one year. In 1986 he dropped out of the course in his final term, and was subsequently fired from his job at a hospital due to his poor attitude. Lépine began a computer programming course in 1988, and again abandoned it before completion. He twice applied for admission to the École Polytechnique, but lacked two required compulsory courses.
Lépine had long complained about women working in &#34;non-traditional&#34; jobs. After several months of planning, including the purchase of a semi-automatic rifle, he entered the École Polytechnique on the afternoon of December 6, 1989, separated the men from the women in a classroom, and shot the women, while yelling, &#34;I hate feminists&#34;, claiming that he was &#34;fighting feminism&#34;. He then moved into other parts of the building, targeting only the women, before killing himself. His suicide note blamed feminists for ruining his life.
Lépine&#39;s actions have been variously ascribed from a psychiatry perspective with diagnoses such as personality disorder, psychosis, or attachment disorder, noting societal factors such as poverty, isolation, powerlessness, and violence in the media. The massacre is regarded by criminologists as an example of a hate crime against women, and by feminists and government officials as a misogynist attack and an example of the larger issue of violence against women. December 6 is now observed in Canada as a National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women.
Life[edit]
Childhood[edit]
Marc Lépine was born Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi on October 26, 1964, in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Algerian immigrant Rachid Liass Gharbi and Canadian nurse Monique Lépine.[3][4] Gamil&#39;s sister, Nadia, was born in 1967.[5] Rachid was a mutual funds salesman and was travelling in the Caribbean at the time of his son&#39;s birth.[6] During his absence, Monique discovered evidence that her husband had been having an affair.[7] Rachid was a non-practising Muslim, and Monique a former Catholic nun who had rejected organized religion after she left the convent.[8] Their son was baptized a Catholic as an infant, but received no religious instruction during his childhood;[4][9] his mother described her son as &#34;a confirmed atheist all his life&#34;.[10]
Instability and violence marked the family: they moved frequently, and much of young Lépine&#39;s early childhood was spent in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, where his father worked for a Swiss mutual funds company.[4][11] The family returned to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock market crash led to the loss of much of the family&#39;s assets.[4] Rachid was an authoritarian, possessive and jealous man, frequently violent towards his wife and children.[12] He had contempt for women and believed that they were intended only to serve men.[13] He required his wife to act as his personal secretary, slapping her if she made any errors in typing, and forcing her to retype documents in spite of the cries of their toddler.[11][14] He was also neglectful and abusive towards his children, particularly his son,[10] and discouraged any tenderness as he considered it spoiling.[13][15][16]
In 1970, following an incident in which Rachid struck Gamil so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, Monique decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976.[17][18] Following the separation, Gamil lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Rachid defaulted on mortgage payments. Gamil was afraid of his father, and at first saw him on weekly supervised visits.[17] The visits ended quickly, as Rachid ceased contact with his children soon after the separation.[4][19] Gamil never saw his father again, and in the future refused to discuss him with others.[20]
Rachid stopped making child support payments after paying them twice, and to make ends meet Monique returned to nursing.[21] She subsequently started taking further courses to advance her career. During this time the children lived with other families during the week, seeing their mother only on weekends.[4][22] Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at St. Justine&#39;s Hospital in 1976; the assessment concluded there was nothing wrong with the shy and withdrawn Gamil, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging Monique&#39;s authority.[23] Nadia died in 1996 at the age of 28 from a drug overdose of cocaine.
Adolescence[edit]
After the divorce became final in 1976, the Lépine children, then aged 12 and 9, returned to live with their mother, who was director of nursing at a Montreal hospital.[24] In 1977 the family moved to a house purchased in the middle-class Montreal suburb of Pierrefonds.[4][25] Gamil attended junior high and high school, where he was described as a quiet student who obtained average to above average marks. He developed a close friendship with another boy, but he did not fit in with other students.[4] Taunted as an Arab because of his name, at the age of 14 he legally changed it to &#34;Marc Lépine&#34;, citing his hatred of his father as the reason for taking his mother&#39;s surname.[4][26] Lépine was uncommunicative and showed little emotion.[1] He suffered from low self-esteem, exacerbated by his chronic acne.[27] Family relations remained difficult; his younger sister Nadia publicly humiliated him about his acne and his lack of girlfriends. Lépine fantasized about her death, and on one occasion made a mock grave for her.[28] He was overjoyed when in 1981 she was placed in a group home because of her delinquent behaviour and drug abuse.[29]
Seeking a good male role model for Lépine, his mother arranged for a Big Brother. For two years, the experience proved positive as Lépine, often with his best friend, enjoyed the time with photography and moto-cross motorcycles. However, in 1979, the meetings ceased abruptly when the Big Brother was detained on suspicion of molesting young boys. Both Lépine and his Big Brother denied that any molestation had occurred.[4][30] Lépine owned an air rifle as a teenager, which he used to shoot pigeons near his home with his friend. They also enjoyed designing and building electronic gadgets.[31] Lépine developed an interest in World War II and an admiration of Adolf Hitler,[32] and enjoyed action and horror movies.[33] He also took considerable responsibility at home, including cleaning and doing repairs while his mother worked.[4][34]
Lépine applied to join the Canadian Forces as an officer cadet in September 1981 at the age of 17, but was rejected during the interview process. He later told his friend it was because of difficulties accepting authority, and in his suicide letter noted that he had been found to be &#34;anti-social&#34;.[18][35] An official statement from the military after the massacre stated that he had been &#34;interviewed, assessed and determined to be unsuitable&#34;.[4]
Adulthood[edit]
In 1982, at the age of 18, the Lépine family moved to Saint-Laurent, closer to his mother&#39;s work and to Lépine&#39;s new CEGEP. He lost contact with his school friend soon after the move. This period marks the beginning of the seven years which he described in his suicide note as having &#34;brought [him] no joy&#34;.[36]
In August 1982 Lépine began a two-year pre-university course in pure sciences at Cégep de Saint-Laurent, failing two courses in the first semester but improving his grades considerably in the second semester.[16][36] He worked part-time at the hospital where his mother worked, serving food and doing custodial duties. Lépine was seen as nervous, hyperactive, and immature by his colleagues. He developed an attraction to another employee, but he was too shy to act on his feelings.[37][38] After a year at college, he switched from the university-destined science program into electronics technology, a three-year technical program geared more towards immediate employment. His teachers remembered him as being a model student, quiet, hardworking, and generally doing well in his classes, particularly those related to electrotechnology. There was an unexplained drop in his marks in the fall 1985 term and in February 1986, during the last term of the program, he suddenly and without explanation stopped attending classes, as a result failing to complete his diploma.[16][36]
Lépine moved out of his mother&#39;s home into his own apartment,[36] and in 1986 he applied to study engineering at École Polytechnique de Montréal. He was admitted on the condition that he complete two compulsory courses, including one in solution chemistry.[1] In 1987, Lépine was fired from his job at the hospital for aggressive behaviour, as well as disrespect of his superiors and carelessness in his work. He was enraged at his dismissal, and at the time described a plan to commit a murderous rampage and then commit suicide.[39] Lépine&#39;s friends noted that he became unpredictable, flying into rages when frustrated.[40]
In the fall of 1987, in order to complete his college diploma, Lépine took three courses, obtaining good marks in all of them,[36][41] and in February 1988 began a course in computer programming at a private college in downtown Montreal, funding his studies with government student loans.[16] He moved into a downtown apartment with his old high school friend,[1][36][42] and in the winter of 1989 took a CEGEP night course in solution chemistry, a prerequisite course for the École Polytechnique.[1] Lépine wanted a girlfriend, but was generally ill at ease around women. He tended to boss women around and show off his knowledge in front of them.[42][43] He spoke out to men about his dislike of feminists, career women and women in traditionally male occupations, such as the police force, stating that women should remain in the home caring for their families.[18][44][45] Lépine applied again to the École Polytechnique in 1989; however his application was rejected as he lacked required courses. In March 1989 he abandoned the course in computer programming,[36] though he performed well in the CEGEP course, obtaining 100% in his final exam.[37] In April 1989 he met with a university admissions officer and complained about how women were taking over the job market from men.[46]
Massacre[edit]
Main article: École Polytechnique massacre
Exterior of École Polytechnique de Montréal
The massacre appeared to have been planned for several months.[47] In August 1989 Lépine picked up an application for a firearms-acquisition certificate, and in mid-October he received his permit.[36] On November 21, 1989, he purchased a Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifle at a local sporting goods store. Between October and December 1989 he was seen at least seven times at the École Polytechnique.[1][47] Four days before the shooting, Lépine brought his mother a present, though it was several weeks before her birthday;[15] he also brought a note and two bags of belongings, which she did not discover until long after the shooting.[48] Lépine had previously always been very punctual paying his rent, but had not done so in December 1989.[36]
On December 6, 1989, Lépine walked into the École Polytechnique. There, he entered a second-floor classroom where he separated the men and women and then ordered the approximately fifty men to leave. Claiming that he was fighting feminism, he shot the nine women who remained, killing six and injuring the rest. After this, Lépine moved to other areas of the building, including the cafeteria, corridors and another classroom. A total of fourteen women (twelve engineering students, one nursing student, and one university employee) were killed, and four men and ten women injured before Lépine turned the gun on himself.[1][49] The event was later described as a &#34;pseudo-community&#34; type of &#34;pseudo-commando&#34; murder-suicide, in which the perpetrator targets a specific group, usually in a public place and intending to die in &#34;a blaze of glory&#34;.[50]
A three-page suicide letter was found in the pocket of Lépine&#39;s jacket.[1] The letter was never officially made public, but was leaked in November 1990 to Francine Pelletier and published in the newspaper La Presse. In his letter, Lépine claimed political motives, blamed feminists for ruining his life, and expressed admiration for Denis Lortie, who had mounted an attack on the Quebec National Assembly in 1984 for political reasons, killing three Quebec government employees.[51] The letter also contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because of their feminism.[52] Another letter, written to a friend, promised the explanation to the massacre lay by following clues left in Lépine&#39;s apartment. The hunt led only to a suitcase of computer games and hardware.[53]
Lépine was buried in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges in Montreal, a few blocks from where he committed the massacre.[54]
Rationale[edit]
A police psychiatrist who interviewed Lépine&#39;s family and entourage, and who had access to his letters, suggested that he may have had a serious personality disorder, as he chose the multiple homicide/suicide strategy (killing oneself after killing others) that is a characteristic of this disorder. The psychiatrist noted &#34;extreme narcissistic vulnerability&#34; as shown by fantasies of power and success combined with high levels of self-criticism and difficulties dealing with rejection and failure. Feelings of powerlessness and incompetence were compensated for by a violent and grandiose imaginary life.[1][55] Other psychiatrists suggested that Lépine was psychotic, having lost touch with reality as he tried to erase the memories of a brutal and absent father, while at the same time unconsciously identifying with a violent manhood that dominates women. Other theories were that Lépine&#39;s experiences of abuse as a child had caused brain damage or led him to feel victimized as he faced losses and rejections in his later life.[56]
Lépine&#39;s mother speculated that he may have suffered from attachment disorder due to the abuse and sense of abandonment he had experienced in his childhood. She also wondered whether Lépine viewed her as a feminist, and that the massacre might have been an unconscious attempt to get revenge for her neglect while she pursued her career and for his sister&#39;s taunts.[57] Others take a less individualistic approach. Many feminists and governmental officials view it as an illustration of misogynistic violence against women.[58][59][60] Criminologists consider the massacre as an example of a hate or bias crime against women.[61][62] A few antifeminists have sought to rehabilitate Lépine as hero of the antifeminist cause.[63][64][65][66][67] Others wondered if Lépine&#39;s actions were the result of societal changes that had led to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation[68][69] or increased violence in the media and in society.[15][70]
Suicide statement[edit]
The following is a translation of the suicide letter written by Lépine on the day of the shooting.[71]
The original letter in French is also available.
Forgive the mistakes, I had 15 minutes to write this. See also Annex.Please note that if I commit suicide today 89-12-06 it is not for economic reasons (for I have waited until I exhausted all my financial means, even refusing jobs) but for political reasons. Because I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to their Maker. For seven years life has brought me no joy and being totally blasé, I have decided to put an end to those viragos.
I tried in my youth to enter the Forces as an officer cadet, which would have allowed me possibly to get into the arsenal and precede Lortie in a raid. They refused me because asocial  [sic]. I therefore had to wait until this day to execute my plans. In between, I continued my studies in a haphazard way for they never really interested me, knowing in advance my fate. Which did not prevent me from obtaining very good marks despite my theory of not handing in work and the lack of studying before exams.
Even if the Mad Killer epithet will be attributed to me by the media, I consider myself a rational erudite that only the arrival of the Grim Reaper has forced to take extreme acts. For why persevere to exist if it is only to please the government. Being rather backward-looking by nature (except for science), the feminists have always enraged me. They want to keep the advantages of women (e.g. cheaper insurance, extended maternity leave preceded by a preventative leave, etc.) while seizing for themselves those of men.
Thus it is an obvious truth that if the Olympic Games removed the Men-Women distinction, there would be women only in the graceful events. So the feminists are not fighting to remove that barrier. They are so opportunistic they [do not][note 2] neglect to profit from the knowledge accumulated by men through the ages. They always try to misrepresent them every time they can. Thus, the other day, I heard they were honoring the Canadian men and women who fought at the frontline during the world wars. How can you explain [that since][note 3] women were not authorized to go to the frontline??? Will we hear of Caesar&#39;s female legions and female galley slaves who of course took up 50% of the ranks of history, though they never existed. A real Casus Belli.
Sorry for this too brief letter.
Marc Lépine
The letter is followed by the list of nineteen names, with a note at the bottom:
&#34;Nearly died today. The lack of time (because I started too late) has allowed these radical feminists to survive. Alea iacta est.&#34;
Memorial[edit]
Canadians mark the day of the killings with a National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. In 2008, Monique Lépine published Aftermath, a memoir of her own journey through the grief and pain of the incident. She had stayed silent until 2006, when she decided to speak out for the first time in the wake of that year&#39;s Dawson College shooting.[72]
In popular culture[edit]
Lépine&#39;s life and death was dramatized by Adam Kelly in his controversial play The Anorak.[73]
Lépine was portrayed by Maxim Gaudette in the 2009 film Polytechnique, although the film never refers to Lépine by name. Gaudette won a Genie Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lépine.[74]
Notes[edit]
^ Note: Many sources state thirteen were wounded, but the Coroner&#39;s report and the police officer responsible for the investigation state that 14 were wounded.
^ Note: Original French is &#34;Elles sont tellement opportunistes qu’elles ne négligent pas de profiter&#34;. A negative is missing from the published translation.
^ Note: Original French is &#34;Comment expliquer cela alors que les femmes...&#34;. The inaccurate published translation was &#34;..explain then that...&#34;
