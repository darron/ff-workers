Toronto Police have just revealed a disturbing link between the recent murders of two young men in Toronto — neither of whom knew each other, or the complete stranger who shot them to death on separate occasions in different parts of the city.
It would appear as though 21-year-old international student Kartik Vasudev and 35-year-old Toronto resident Elijah Eleazar Mahepath were both tragically and inexplicably killed by the same person within just over 48 hours of each other.
Both attacks are believed to have been completely random, and police fear that there would have been more slayings if not for the quick actions of investigators, who located 39-year-old suspect Richard Jonathan Edwin in his home at Bloor and Spadina surrounded by firearms on Sunday evening.
&#34;Given that he had already killed two apparent strangers, as we allege, and that a cache of firearms was located in his residence, we can reasonably conclude that the quick work of our investigators has prevented a further loss of life,&#34; said Toronto Police Chief James Ramer during a press conference at TPS headquarters on Tuesday.
&#34;My personal opinion is that there were going to be more victims. When? I don&#39;t know, but he had an arsenal at home, and I quite frankly believe this might have been the first step,&#34; said Ramer in response to a question later in the presser. &#34;I think the intention was to continue.&#34;

Police announced this morning that Edwin had been arrested and is charged with two counts of first degree murder in connection with homicides number 19 and 20 of 2022.
The first victim, Kartik Vasudev, was an international student studying business at Seneca College. He had arrived in Toronto from his native India just four months prior to his killing.
Police say that Vasudev was &#34;approached by a complete stranger&#34; around 5 p.m. on Thursday, April 7, at the Glen Road entrance of Sherbourne Subway Station.
&#34;Investigators allege that Richard Jonathan Edwin discharged a handgun striking the victim multiple times before fleeing the scene,&#34; said police in a release on Tuesday.
Vasudev was located with multiple gunshot wounds and taken to hospital where he died as a result of his injuries, sparking a torrent of outcries for justice among his peers in both Toronto and India.

Two days later, on Saturday, April 9, just before 7 p.m., 35-year-old Elijah Eleazar Mahepath of Toronto was similarly approached by an apparent stranger and shot multiple times on the north side of Dundas Street East near George Street.
Mahepath, who was said to have been out shopping for groceries, was rushed to hospital and succumbed to his injuries.
&#34;He was just coming from running errands, grocery shopping, on his way to his next location, and for reasons that are unclear and may never be clear, his life was taken,&#34; said Detective Sergeant Terry Browne of TPS Homicide when referring to Mahepath.
While they acknowledged that both victims were visible minorities, police are not labelling the incidents as hate crimes at this time.
&#34;I wouldn&#39;t want to speculate on whether someone was targeted based on their background or ethnicity, because we just don&#39;t have that information,&#34; said Browne when asked about the link, noting that it&#39;s unclear if the suspect ever even had face-to-face sightlines with the victims.
&#34;We can&#39;t say with certainty that he would have in fact been able to see their ethnicity,&#34; said Browne.
&#34;We have nothing to suggest he knew either one of them, and more importantly, what we believe at this stage anyways, is that it was what we do describe as random. It was a chance meeting, a chance passing, and for reasons that are only known to the suspect, these two people were victimized on that day, and now are dead.&#34;

With the assistance of the Emergency Task Force, Toronto Police entered Edwin&#39;s home in the Bloor and Spadina area on the evening of April, 10, and arrested him safely and without incident, &#34;despite the fact that the accused had several loaded firearms on the floor next to him.&#34;
A search warrant of the home revealed several firearms on the premises, including handguns, rifles, loaded magaiznes and other ammunition.
Ramer says that Edwin&#39;s swift arrest was the result of an &#34;all out effort to track the killer&#34; with help from the TTC, Metrolinx and members of the public.
The suspect remains in custody, and police say they have no reason to believe there is an ongoing threat to the public. Not anymore.
&#34;What was he planning?&#34; said Browne of the suspect. &#34;Perhaps there was something planned for the future. We don&#39;t know that. We do know that it&#39;s not going to happen. If something was planned, it&#39;s not going to happen... because quick action was taken.&#34;
Ramer is reminding all members of the public to stay cautious and vigilant while out in public, and that &#34;if  you see something, you have to say something.&#34;

Edwin briefly appeared in court by videoconference Wednesday morning.  (Lauren Foster-MacLeod/CBC)On the morning that a man charged in connection with two separate &#34;unprovoked&#34; killings of a 35-year-old man and a 21-year-old international student in Toronto first appeared in court, one of the victim&#39;s fathers says he is still reeling, and desperate for answers about the person police believe is responsible. &#34;There is a motive behind it, what was he thinking before the killings?

The Toronto police arrested Richard Jonathan Edwin, 39, and charged him with the April 7 murder of Kartik Vasudev, a 21-year-old Indian student, and the unrelated killing of Elijah Eleazar Mahepath, who was shot on April 9. Both victims were shot and killed within a span of 72 hours.
A CBC report quoting the police said Edwin, who senselessly shot Vasudev was arrested on April 10 evening and had a cache of loaded guns within reach at the time of his arrest. Investigators reportedly believe that Edwin was a “complete stranger” to both men, who also didn’t know each other.
Vasudev was shot multiple times outside a Toronto subway station and two nights later, Mahepath, 35, was shot while running errands downtown. Police, according to Globe and Mail, do not yet know much about the suspect or his motivations. He has no criminal record.
“We have nothing to suggest he knew either one of them,” said Detective Sargent Terry Browne of Toronto Police Service according to news reports. He characterized the killings could be completely random — “a chance meeting, a chance passing.”
Significantly, the police said that they are not sure that the perpetrator and the victims even saw each other directly. “It is unclear if the suspect ever even had face-to-face sightlines with the victims, Stg. Browne was quoted as saying in news reports.
That’s probably why the police though acknowledging that both the victims are “visible minorities,” are not yet ready to categorize them as hate crimes.
“I wouldn’t want to speculate on whether someone was targeted based on their background or ethnicity … Certainly from what we saw, any interaction with the shooter and the victims was very, very quick and brief,” Browne was quoted as saying.
The police are also intrigued by the fact that Edwin had no prior record and the gun he used in his killing was bought legally. Yet, going by the arsenal found at his home the police believe he was planning further attacks.

Meanwhile, the body of Kartik Vasudev, arrived in Ghaziabad near New Delhi to be cremated by his distraught family.
Kartik Vasudev’s father is demanding that the police investigate the motives behind the murders. “There is a motive behind it, what was he thinking before the killings? We need to find out these questions,” a news report quoted Jitesh Vasudev, as saying.
In a heartrending Facebook post, Jitesh Vasudev wrote: “When I got the most devastating news of my life – ‘Your son was shot’ – I broke down! How could this be? My Kartik, my 21-year-old boy? Who would do this? WHY would they do this? I had no answers! When I broke the news to my wife, she wasn’t ready to accept it. All she kept saying was, ‘Aap jhooth bol rahe ho. Nothing has happened to my son!’ It took her a day to accept the truth, we cried together. But after the initial shock wore off, I was filled with anger. I wanted to look the person in the eye and ask why?!

Police have since arrested one man in connection with both deaths. (Toronto Police Service - image credit)Toronto police have arrested a man accused of two separate &#34;unprovoked&#34; killings of a 21-year-old international student and 35-year-old man.Richard Jonathan Edwin, 39, has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Kartik Vasudev and Elijah Eleazar Mahepath.Police say Edwin was arrested Sunday evening and had a cache of loaded guns within reach at the time of his arrest.&#34;Any death is tragic, but these men were completely innocent, and their murders were absolutely random acts of violence,&#34; Police Chief James Ramer told reporters Tuesday.Vasudev, a 21-year-old international student from India, was gunned down at Sherbourne subway station on April 7 around 5 p.m. He was transported to hospital with multiple gunshot wounds, where he later died.Two days later, Mahepath was shot several times near the intersection of Dundas Street East and George Street, east of Jarvis Street, just before 7 p.m. He also died in hospital hours later.Police believe Edwin was a &#34;complete stranger&#34; to both men. Ramer also said the victims were not known to each other.Evan Mitsui/CBCEdwin had no prior criminal record and was &#34;lawfully&#34; in possession of his guns, police said.Ramer said he believes there could have been more killings had the suspect not been caught.&#34;When, I don&#39;t know, but he had an arsenal at home,&#34; Ramer said. &#34;Frankly, I believe this might have just been a first step.&#34;&#34;Police are doing a &#34;very deep dive&#34; into Edwin&#39;s background to find out more about &#34;who this person is, where he&#39;s been, who he&#39;s been associating with,&#34; Det. Sgt. Terry Browne said.Browne added that both victims were people of colour, but would not speculate on whether they were targeted based on their background or ethnicity.&#34;We just don&#39;t have that information,&#34; he said. &#34;But certainly from what we saw, any interaction with the shooter and the victims was very, very quick and brief, and we can&#39;t say with certainty whether in fact, he would have been able to see their ethnicity.&#34;Vasudev and Mahepath were the city&#39;s 19th and 20th homicides of the year.Neighbours recount arrestBased on the &#34;nature of the offences,&#34; Browne said police were able to connect the two homicides to one another &#34;very quickly.&#34;Ramer says an &#34;all-out effort&#34; was launched to track the suspect, with the help of the Toronto police&#39;s Emergency Task Force. Edwin was found and arrested in a building near Bloor Street West and Spadina Avenue on Sunday evening.Investigators say they seized several firearms, including handguns, rifles, loaded magazines, and other ammunition.Neighbours of Edwin say they were shocked by his arrest — and to learn of the charges against him&#34;He seemed like a nice guy, I would talk to him and he would always say, &#39;Hey,&#39; to me,&#34; said Benjamin Hannah, who lives in the same building as Edwin.Ivan Arsovski/CBCHannah was working by his window when the arrest happened, and recalls seeing officers arrive and then hearing loud noises in the basement.&#34;It was like something out of a movie,&#34; he said.Lily Whittle, who also lives in the building, says she was on her way to get groceries during the arrest. She says she heard a police officer yell, &#39;Get on the ground.&#39;&#34;Since Edwin&#39;s arrest, she says officers have been stationed at the building and along the street.&#34;I&#39;m glad that they got everything handled,&#34; Whittle said.Loved ones describe Vasudev as &#39;polite, gentle&#39; Ramer said he hopes the arrest will provide a &#34;sliver of closure&#34; for the families of the victims.Vasudev&#39;s father, Jitesh Vasudev, said in an interview from India that the family is devastated.&#34;Anyone who knows him, he was very polite, gentle, a brilliant student,&#34; Jitesh told CBC Toronto on Tuesday.Courtesy of the Vasudev familyVasudev said goodbye to his father, mother and 16-year-old brother earlier this year to pursue his studies in Canada. He arrived in Toronto on Jan. 5 after years of planning his career and a new life here.He was in the first semester of business management at Seneca College and was heading to his part-time job when he was killed.&#34;I sent my child over there for his studies, and within three months, somebody randomly just shot him,&#34; the victim&#39;s father said.Family &#39;grateful&#39; for arrestFamily, friends and coworkers of Vasudev gathered for a vigil at Nathan Phillips Square over the weekend, remembering him as a bright and ambitious student.Police said they also spoke with the victim&#39;s family, who are &#34;grateful&#34; for the arrest.Despite the development, Jitesh said he&#39;s still searching for answers.Courtesy of the Vasudev family&#34;I just close my eyes and imagine that scene and what happened to my child,&#34; Jitesh said through tears.The family&#39;s grief, he said, has been made worse by the fact that the shooting happened &#34;thousands of miles&#34; away.&#34;We thought [Canada] was a safe country,&#34; the victim&#39;s mother, Pooja Vasudev, said.&#34;Now, if someone asks me, I won&#39;t tell them that Canada is a safe country,&#34; Jitesh added.Now, the couple is left waiting for their son&#39;s body to arrive in India on Saturday.Police didn&#39;t provide many details on Mahepath on Tuesday, except to say that loved ones describe him as a &#34;happy-go-lucky&#34; person.Police said he was just running errands when he was randomly attacked.&#34;His family is devastated,&#34; Browne said.HomeShoppingReviewsFather&#39;s Day Health &amp; WellnessCelebrityRoyalsFashionBeautyParentingBetter AtFoodWatchTerms and Privacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardHelpShare your feedbackAbout UsAbout Our AdsSite mapFollow us ontwitterfacebookinstagrampinterestDownload our app© 2023 Yahoo.
