(CBC News)Basil Borutski has been found guilty of murdering three of his former partners in a shocking one-day killing rampage in Renfrew County, Ont., that has been called one of the worst cases of domestic violence in Canadian history.A jury of six men and five women returned guilty verdicts on two counts of first-degree and one count of second-degree murder just after 2:30 p.m. Friday.Borutski, 60, refused to stand as the madam foreperson of the jury read the verdicts: guilty of first-degree murder in the shootings of Anastasia Kuzyk and Nathalie Warmerdam at their homes in Wilno and Foymount, and guilty of second-degree murder in the strangling of Carol Culleton at her cottage near Combermere.His sentencing has been scheduled for Dec. 5-6 at the courthouse in Pembroke, Ont.TONIGHT | Watch The Fifth Estate: Circle of Fear: Basil Borutski and the Renfrew County Murders  at 9 p.m.Borutski remained silent over the seven weeks of proceedings against him, but broke that silence about halfway through Ontario Superior Court Justice Robert Maranger&#39;s instructions to the jury Wednesday, to accuse the judge of lying.And Borutski spoke again after the jury retired to deliberate.&#34;I&#39;m not guilty,&#34; he said, pulling on his green coat in the prisoner&#39;s box.The jury determined otherwise after about 14 hours of deliberations over three days.This is what happened.Leaves apartment 7:36 a.m.At 7:36 a.m. on Sept. 22, 2015, Borutski walked out of his apartment at 5967 Palmer Rd. in Palmer Rapids, Ont., in a camouflage hat and pants, as if he were going hunting. He had with him a decades-old, sawed-off 12-gauge pump-action shotgun he later told police he&#39;d found under the floorboards of an old motor home in a scrapyard.He borrowed a neighbour&#39;s car and drove to a gas station just up the road. The gas light was on and he needed to fuel up, but the station was closed.Surveillance video captures Borutski leaving his apartment at 7:36 a.m. on Sept. 22, 2015. (Ontario Superior Court of Justice)After sitting there in the parking lot for a time he drove next to a cottage owned by Culleton at 670 Kamaniskeg Lake Rd. near Combermere, Ont. — a short trip, about 15 minutes northwest.He called her Jiggy; &#34;jig for fisher,&#34; he would later tell police, hours after her murder. &#34;Here&#39;s the bait, take the bait away, here&#39;s the bait, take the bait away. I told her, &#39;That&#39;s the way you treat me, Carol.&#39;&#34;They&#39;d been in a relationship a couple years back and in early 2015 he popped up in her life again, offering to help get her cottage ready to sell. She was close to retiring from her work as a pay analyst for the federal public service, her longtime partner had died of cancer, and she was looking to downsize.Borutski told her he was bored and needed something to do. It would be cheap. She&#39;d save some money.Strange behaviourBut it didn&#39;t take long for the renewed friendship to sour, for his behaviour to become strange and worrisome.Culleton told friends and colleagues she was annoyed with how he&#39;d start new projects she didn&#39;t ask for without finishing others, and that she was starting to feel like the cottage wasn&#39;t hers anymore.This was Culleton&#39;s cottage at 670 Kamaniskeg Lake Rd. (OPP/Ontario Superior Court of Justice)He made a habit of showing up unannounced, tore up flowers he planted after she sat on another man&#39;s knee a couple weeks before her murder, and gave her a shock by showing up at her house in rural south Ottawa — she was sure she hadn&#39;t given him the address, but he told her it was on a card she&#39;d given him once.&#34;I said, &#39;Carol, you&#39;ve got a stalker. He&#39;s stalking you,&#39;&#34; her friend Ron Ethier testified.The text messages between them bore out Borutski&#39;s desperation, his need to control Culleton, his wish for her to see him in a certain light. In the two weeks leading up to her murder he sent her more than a hundred messages — she sent only 15 in reply.Asks Borutski to stop bothering herIt came to a head the weekend of her retirement, the weekend before her killing. She had reunited with her boyfriend and asked Borutski to stop bothering her.It stung him to the quick, and he sent more than a dozen unanswered texts begging for an explanation, to talk, to be friends.This photo, taken from a thumb drive found in Culleton&#39;s cottage, shows flowers Borutski planted torn up and thrown into a boat on her property. It happened a couple weeks before her murder, and she told friends he was upset because she sat on another man&#39;s knee in front of him. (Carol Culleton/Ontario Superior Court of Justice)He showed up at the cottage on Monday, the day before he murdered her, and she told her friend Ron Ethier that Borutski &#34;was very upset&#34; and collecting his things. Borutski&#39;s last texts to Culleton were sent around 6 p.m. that day.&#34;You are a cruel vindictive self centred human being.you have no heart and no concionce...you hooked me real good I believed you and in you [...] you got me for about $10.000 in labour and another 2 or 3 thousand in cash I spent on you and your cottage...congratulations..I will never text or talk to you again...be happy...karma will pay you for your heartless ways...bye....wish I never met you.&#39;&#34;I will endure the betrayal of yet another false friend....I all fill [...] everyone else in on the true you....karma will take over..&#34;When he arrived at the cottage the next morning, Culleton was alone.The following is Borutski&#39;s own account of what happened, taken from the five-hour interview he gave to OPP Det. Sgt. Caley O&#39;Neill the day after his arrest.&#39;This is not you, Basil&#39;&#34;And I remember thinking that God is really helping me, because when I went to Carol&#39;s, Carol walked right outside. And then I asked her, I said, &#39;Why do you hate me,&#39; or &#39;Why are you doing this to me,&#39; or both,&#34; Borutski said.&#34;And then she closed the door, I was right there, and then I broke the window with my elbow and I reached in and I unlocked the door. And she said, &#39;This is not you, Basil, this not you.&#39;&#34;Then she told me that [a man] was coming over because the hydro was out, and I said, &#39;You&#39;re lying to me again,&#39; and there was a, a cable TV coil, I picked it up and I hit her with it, then I wrapped it around her head. And she just kept saying, &#39;This is not you, Basil, this is not you.&#39;&#34;Borutski smoked a cigarette and left the butt in Culleton&#39;s kitchen sink. DNA linked to Borutski was found on it. (OPP/Ontario Superior Court of Justice)After it was done he smoked a cigarette, left the butt in Culleton&#39;s kitchen sink, dumped out the contents of her purse and took her cellphone and keys.Then he abandoned his neighbour&#39;s car, left $100 inside for gas, stole Culleton&#39;s car and drove northeast.There had been no witnesses, no calls to police. There was no manhunt, no one looking for him.That would soon change.Drives to second victimFrom Culleton&#39;s cottage it was about a half-hour drive northeast to the home of Kuzyk, the second victim.Borutski&#39;s relationship with her happened not long after his initial romantic relationship with Culleton. A friend of Kuzyk and Warmerdam, Genevieve Way, told CBC News Warmerdam — who had dated him years earlier — warned Kuzyk about Borutski and supported her when their relationship ended.And it ended violently. On Dec. 30, 2013, Borutski assaulted Kuzyk, tried to choke her and caused mischief to her property. He was convicted in September 2014 and was released from jail in December that same year, bound by a two-year probation order and lifetime weapons ban he would ultimately break when he murdered Kuzyk and the others.Anastasia Kuzyk&#39;s house at 37 Szczipior Rd., in Wilno, Ont. (OPP/Ontario Superior Court of Justice)Borutski arrived at Kuzyk&#39;s house at 37 Szczipior Rd. in Wilno, Ont., some time around 8:45 a.m., and when he came to the door, her sister Eva Kuzyk was upstairs.She testified she heard Anastasia scream at the top of her lungs and ran down in time to see a man hide behind the door and Anastasia on the kitchen floor.&#39;Stay away from my sister&#39;&#34;It&#39;s Basil,&#34; Eva remembered Anastasia whispering.Eva rushed to confront him, but by that time he was outside.&#34;My thought was, in order to survive this, you better fight back,&#34; she testified. &#34;At this time, my clear memory is rushing to the door and saying, &#39;Stay away from my sister.&#39;&#34;Eva ran back inside, peered out a window and saw Borutski return, this time with the shotgun.&#39;I thought, we are both going to die&#39;&#34;I thought, we are both going to die. That&#39;s what I thought. Then the gun went off, [it] sounded to me literally behind me. ... I opened the door quickly and I ran for my life. And I thought, &#39;I need to get an ambulance, he probably shot Anastasia, I have to get some help.&#39; And I opened the door and I ran for my life,&#34; Eva testified.In Borutski&#39;s account to police, he accused Kuzyk of lying during the court proceedings against him.&#34;She just walked out and I asked Anastasia, I just said, &#39;Why did you lie in court?&#39; And she said, &#39;I didn&#39;t,&#39; and the gun went off, because it just — lies,&#34; Borutski said. &#34;There was a little island and she was standing, and she just went down and the gun went off after she went down. It was as if it was supposed to be.&#34;Eva Kuzyk, Anastasia&#39;s sister, was upstairs when Borutski arrived at Anastasia&#39;s house, and ran downstairs when she heard her sister scream. (CBC)When Eva called 911 from a nearby road maintenance crew&#39;s truck at 8:52 a.m., a dispatcher told her a sergeant thought he knew who the attacker was, and that every officer in the area was on the way.Culleton&#39;s body still hadn&#39;t been found, and wouldn&#39;t be for another two hours.Drives to third victimAnd Borutski, meanwhile, drove southeast toward Warmerdam, the third victim.It was about a 30-minute trip to her farmhouse at 3594 Foymount Rd. near Eganville, Ont., where he had lived with her for several years.Nathalie Warmerdam&#39;s farmhouse at 3594 Foymount Rd. near Eganville, Ont. (OPP/Ontario Court of Justice)She volunteered for an organization called Co-operative Policing: Killaloe Area, which aims to improve policing at the Killaloe OPP detachment, and had been Borutski&#39;s biggest ally in his disputes with his former wife.But Warmerdam&#39;s relationship with him eventually soured, too. On July 27, 2012, he caused mischief to her property and threatened to kill her dog and hurt her son.Borutski was convicted in December and was released from jail less than a month later, bound by a two-year probation order he&#39;d eventually break when he assaulted Kuzyk. Part of that probation involved an order to participate in a domestic violence response program, but he never attended a single session, not even after trying to choke Kuzyk.Protected herself with shotgun, surveillance, panic buttonIn the intervening years, Warmerdam took precautions.She slept with a shotgun under her bed. She had a panic alarm issued to survivors of domestic violence. And she had several surveillance cameras installed at her home.Warmerdam slept with a shotgun under her bed, left, and a panic button next to her pillow, right. (OPP/Ontario Court of Justice)One of them captured Borutski&#39;s arrival at the farmhouse at 9:31 a.m. Sept. 22, 2015, and shows him calmly walking inside. She and her then 20-year-old son Adrian were home at the time. It would be over in about a minute.Adrian, now 22, testified he saw Borutski chase his mother toward him.&#34;That&#39;s when I saw her running through the kitchen towards me … I saw somebody was behind her. They rounded the corner, coming through the living room I was in, and then I saw the person following her seemed to be Basil holding a gun, so I immediately ran out of the house,&#34; he said.One of Warmerdam&#39;s surveillance cameras shows Borutski walking into her house with a shotgun at 9:31 a.m. He walked out two minutes later. (Ontario Superior Court of Justice)&#34;On the way out of the house I heard what seemed [to be] a gunshot. I ran out into the bush and I called 911 and waited for police.&#34;He hid in the woods, lay there on his stomach for more than an hour, and stayed on the phone with a 911 dispatcher until police arrived.&#39;The gun was just going off. It was like, boop&#39;Borutski&#39;s own account of the shooting sounded almost nonchalant. By then, after he&#39;d described strangling Culleton and shooting Kuzyk, it was as if confessing to murder was no big deal.&#34;What happened? I just drove in, walked in the door, she was sitting there, she went around the corner, I followed her, boom, walked out, that&#39;s it. ... And it was funny, it was like I wasn&#39;t even pulling the trigger on the gun, the gun was just going off. It was like, boop,&#34; he told police.After shooting Warmerdam he walked calmly back to Culleton&#39;s car and drove east to a &#34;little sawmill&#34; in White Lake, Ont., tossing Culleton&#39;s cellphone out the window along Foymount Road.Borutski stands in a room at the Pembroke OPP detachment shortly after his arrest, his hands tied behind his back. (OPP/Ontario Superior Court of Justice)He was in search of &#34;the fat man,&#34; who had been selling backhoes to Warmerdam and others. Borutski told police he wanted to kill the fat man, but that he wasn&#39;t at the sawmill when he arrived. Borutski spoke to two people who didn&#39;t know where the man was, then drove away.By this time, schools in the area were in secure mode and courthouses were in lockdown. Residents were being asked to stay inside their homes. Other people police thought might be targets were singled out for protection.Police cruisers roamed the streets. Ottawa police were fanning out, too, alerted that Borutski might be heading for the city. And Culleton&#39;s body was discovered by a real estate agent just after 11 a.m.In all, police searched the area for about five hours.Arrested in rural west Ottawa fieldBorutski ended up at a relative&#39;s property off Becks and Kinburn Side roads in the rural west Ottawa community of Kinburn, Ont. He parked Culleton&#39;s car and walked out into the bush, texting his neighbour and his brother Arthur.Helicopters circled overhead. Tactical officers in protective gear were staging nearby, alerted to his presence in the area.Mourners hold a candlelit vigil in remembrance of Culleton, Kuzyk and Warmerdam in Wilno, Ont., on Sept. 25, 2015. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)Borutski admitted to his sickening crimes but accepted no real responsibility for them, texting his brother that it was the system&#39;s fault, that the women were the guilty ones, that no one had listened to him.&#34;Helicopter is circling...I&#39;m in [...] bush....yes I did it....they took my life away on me....I was innocent of every charge ever laid against .e&#34;&#34;The guilty have paid...justice finally...I.m tired&#34;&#34;If they would of listened to me none of this would of happened&#34;&#34;I was not guilty.the system destroyed me..I ha e nothing left&#34;&#34;Murder is killing something innocent..I didn.t.&#34;Officers surrounded him, gradually moved in to make the arrest, and by 2:32 p.m. Borutski was in custody. He told officers where to find the shotgun nearby and was escorted to a cruiser.Silent in court until WednesdayAhead of his trial Maranger ordered a psychiatric assessment for Borutski, but he was silent when the psychiatrist showed up to ask questions. They sat in a room for about 30 minutes, and afterward the psychiatrist could only report that an assessment wasn&#39;t possible.During the vast majority of his trial Borutski didn&#39;t speak a word. He refused to hire a lawyer and therefore represented himself, but made no real attempts to do so, refusing to speak to anyone or accept documents.Day after day, hour after hour, he sat in the prisoner&#39;s box either squeezing his eyes shut, staring blankly ahead, looking around, or resting with his back and head against the glass, his eyes closed. He took notes very rarely, and interrupted proceedings twice by knocking on the glass to ask for a pencil and to pass lawyers some questions to ask a witness.Borutski, seen behind the safety grill, leaves in a police vehicle after appearing at the courthouse in Pembroke, Ont., on Sept. 23, 2015. (Justin Tang/Canadian Press)But that changed Wednesday in the middle of Maranger&#39;s instructions to the jury. Borutski asked the judge whether he missed an explanation, in front of the jury, that it was his time to call evidence and make a closing statement.&#34;Has that happened, have I missed that?&#34; Borutski asked.&#34;At every instance I asked you if you had any questions of a witness in front of the jury. In front of the jury I asked you if you were going to call any evidence. You didn&#39;t. I asked you in front of the jury if you wanted to make closing arguments. So yes, I did do that. I said I was going to do it, and I did it. I did it with exact precision, Mr. Borutski,&#34; Maranger replied.Borutski said he didn&#39;t believe him, then questioned why he hadn&#39;t been given a pencil and paper throughout the proceedings.Crown prosecutor Jeffery Richardson and court-appointed amicus James Foord agreed with Maranger, saying he consistently gave Borutski the chance to speak and raise issues.Sentencing hearingBorutski is automatically sentenced to life in prison for the three murders, but what&#39;s now at issue is when he&#39;ll be able to apply for parole.He will be ineligible to apply for parole for 25 years for the first-degree murder of Kuzyk, and for the first-degree murder of Warmerdam the judge will decide whether Borutski will face another 25 years of parole ineligibility either concurrently or consecutively.As for the second-degree murder of Culleton, Borutski could face another 10 to 25 years of parole ineligibility — again, either concurrently or consecutively.Depending on what Maranger decides, Borutski might have to wait anywhere from 25 to 75 years to apply for parole. That means he will remain in prison until he&#39;s at least 85 years old. The sentencing hearing will also give the families of the victims a chance to be heard through victim impact statements, and the Crown is hoping to present a community impact statement as well.As Maranger noted in court Friday, the three murders left an &#34;indelible mark&#34; on Renfrew County.Borutski will likely also have a chance to address court for the final time, but whether he will or not is anyone&#39;s guess.CBC&#39;s Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Full trial coverage: Review all the court stories filed from Basil Borutski&#39;s trial hereFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Basil Bortuski, a man with a known history of violence against women, killed three former partners in the span of one hour on Sept. 22, 2015. During his rampage, he first strangled Carol Culleton before shooting Anastasia Kuzyk and Nathalie Warmerdam on their properties in the Ottawa Valley. Matt Storey, an officer with the Chief Firearms Office of Ontario, told the inquest Borutski was prohibited from possessing any firearms because of past convictions in 2012 and 2014, but was somehow able to get his hands on the shotgun he used in the rampage.Part of the reason police couldn’t trace where Bortuski got the firearm was because Canada’s long-gun registry was abolished in October 2011, Storey said.“We might’ve been able to trace that and find out if he actually got it from a friend, who that gun was registered to, but since the abolishment, we don’t have those files — those files don’t exist,” he said. “It makes everyone’s job more difficult, right? And for safety of some people, we can’t control necessarily someone who’s prohibited (from) getting a firearm, because there’s no registry involved. So we don’t know where that firearm came from in the first place.”On May 18, 2022, a new federal bill came into effect aimed at strengthening firearms laws in Canada and keeping communities safe from gun violence. Individuals and businesses transferring or selling a non-restricted firearm need to confirm the recipient’s identity and check the validity of their firearms licence with the federal firearms registrar beforehand. Businesses must also keep records of inventory and sales related to non-restricted firearms. The regulations are meant to help police trace guns used in crimes.But Storey said that doesn’t mean the return of the long-gun registry. Records created by businesses are held by businesses — not the government — and the police require judicial authorization to access them.“If the long-gun registry was around still, that would make a big difference,” he said. “If they were actually able to track non-restricted firearms like we are with restricted and prohibited firearms, who has them, who used to have them, that kind of list of tracking purposes, that would help not only law enforcement, but ourselves and other people, and even for lost and stolen firearms, right, like not just something involved in a crime or prohibited.” It would also be beneficial to have people involved in the justice system be well informed about the national Firearms Act, Storey said. “Courts, Crowns, justices and justices of the peace, if they were more familiar with the Firearms Act and some of the repercussions of their orders that they’re making, that would be a good one,” he said. “Mandatory prohibitions aren’t being issued, they’re not being ordered the way they should be and things are being thrown out.” Due to the backlog of court cases caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Storey said firearms charges are being removed “at quite a high pace” and several intimate partner violence cases are “going to peace bonds.” “Where potentially those people who should be prohibited and not having access to firearms, the charges are going away and they’re being given the firearms back. And that comes back to us,” he said. “But we have to try to make that decision now that it’s gone through court and try to determine whether that person should still have firearms or not.”Another way that public safety could be enhanced is making the current spousal support line for concerns regarding people with firearms run round the clock as opposed to just within business hours, Storey suggested.He also said that there are currently no guidance documents available to firearms officers that advise them to look at a firearms applicant’s complete file as opposed to just their past convictions before deciding whether they should be allowed to possess firearms. The inquest, which is considering ways to better protect victims of intimate partner violence, is set to resume Friday.

On January 22, 2016, four people were killed and seven others injured in a shooting spree in La Loche, Saskatchewan, Canada. Two brothers were killed at their home, and two teachers were killed at the Dene Building of the La Loche Community School.[2][3][4][5][6] A 17-year-old male suspect was apprehended and placed into custody.[7][8]
Shootings[edit]
Dene Building on January 24
According to police, the shootings began at a residence in the 300 block of Dene Crescent, where the suspect shot two of his cousins some time before 1:00 p.m.[3][9][10][11] He then went to La Loche Community School&#39;s Dene Building[a] and began firing at around 1:05, shortly before lunch ended, reportedly with a shotgun.[14][15] He fired at least six or seven shots inside the building, killing a teacher and an assistant and wounding seven others.[2][4][6][10] The school shooting lasted for about eight minutes.[16]
Between 1:08 and 1:10, a suspect with a gun was spotted by a responding officer, who chased him through the building and eventually arrested him outside at 1:15.[9][16] Afterwards, police were notified of the bodies at the residence on Dene Crescent.[9] Both the Dene Building and the elementary school were put on lockdown during the shooting.[17] The suspect had reportedly posted his intentions on Facebook.[18][19]
Of about 350 enrolled students, around 150 were at school at the time, since many had taken final exams that morning and had no further classes.[20]
Victims[edit]
The deceased were identified as brothers Dayne, 17, and Drayden Fontaine, 13; and teachers Adam Wood, 35, and Marie Janvier, 21.[21] Janvier and the Fontaine brothers died at the scene, and Wood died later in the local hospital.[16] Seven other people were injured.[2] The four most seriously wounded were flown to and hospitalized at Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon.[15][22] All were in critical condition two days after the shootings, according to an official in the Saskatchewan government.[23] On January 27, an official said three had been released.[24] A fourth was released on February 12.[22]
Perpetrator[edit]
Police did not release the name of the suspect at the time, as he was protected by a publication ban as required by Canada&#39;s Youth Criminal Justice Act.[21] Police said he was a student at the school and that he is 17.[7][25] According to friends, he was bullied at school for his appearance.[26] After the Supreme Court of Canada appeal, the publication ban was lifted revealing his name to be Randan Dakota Fontaine.[27] After the publication ban was lifted, his court statement gave no rationale for his attack, and Fontaine repeatedly denied he was bullied.[28]
Reactions and aftermath[edit]
Media vehicles on La Loche Avenue
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, U.S. Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman and other Canadian politicians issued statements expressing their condolences and shock at the shooting.[17][29][30][31] Wall pledged counselling support and to cover costs for those travelling to see the hospitalized victims in Saskatoon. Kevin Janvier,[b] the acting mayor of La Loche, and Georgina Jolibois, MP for the Desnethé—Missinippi—Churchill River electoral district, called to have the school torn down and rebuilt in light of the trauma caused by the shootings.[23]
On January 23, prior to a hockey game at the Air Canada Centre, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens had a minute of silence for the victims.[33]
Flowers at the Dene Building
RCMP Superintendent Grant St. Germaine called the incident the worst shooting tragedy in Canadian history at a high school or elementary school.[32] Reuters reported that it was the worst Canadian school shooting since the École Polytechnique massacre of 1989, in which fourteen were killed.[34][c]
Classes at La Loche Community School were suspended immediately after the shooting. On January 26, the local school board, Northern Lights School Division No. 113, told parents the school would reopen in seven to ten more days, though the reopening was postponed to at least February 22.[20][35] Plans to tear down the school were considered, but not passed.[36] It said that it was willing to implement a security program at that time, following community discussion on what that should entail. In the meantime, the elementary school building remains open for students to gather, receive counselling, and play floor hockey.[20] Exams for the first semester were cancelled for students who had not taken them on the morning of the shootings.[37]
On January 29, Trudeau and Wall visited La Loche, where the former met with community leaders. Earlier that morning, a moment of silence was held in schools located across Saskatchewan.[38]
Legal proceedings[edit]
On January 23, the suspect was charged with four counts of first-degree murder, seven counts of attempted murder, and one count of unauthorized possession of a firearm.[7] Two days later, he was arraigned in a provincial court in Meadow Lake, then remanded to a youth facility. As of August 2016, the suspect had appeared in court seven times and his next court date was scheduled for October 28. Authorities have stated that they would like to sentence him as an adult if he is convicted.[39][40] On October 28, 2016 the teen pleaded guilty to two counts of first degree murder, two counts of second degree murder and seven counts of attempted murder.[41] On May 8, 2018, the gunman was sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of parole for 10 years.[42]  On October 31, 2019, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeals upheld his conviction and adult sentence.[43]  On April 16, 2020, the Supreme Court of Canada refused leave to appeal his conviction and sentence. As a result, he has exhausted all of his legal appeals.[44]

Scarborough Crossbow Killer Brett Ryan
Published August 25, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.

The screaming of the victims went on for about five minutes, said Jerome Cruz, a neighbour of the Scarborough home where two men and a woman were found dead.
“After that, all quiet.”
On August 25, 2016, 35-year-old Brett Ryan did the unthinkable.
He murdered his mother so she couldn’t tell his fiancé he was a liar. Then he murdered two of his brothers and attempted to kill the third after they tried to come to their mother’s aid.
Three people died because Brett Ryan refused to tell his fiancé the truth: he lost his job when his employer found out about his criminal past.
Ryan was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder. He pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder.
Justice John McMahon sentenced Brett Ryan to 25 years with no chance of parole.
A Criminal Past
In 2007, Brett Ryan robbed thirteen banks, netting a total of just $28,000.
In January 2009, he was convicted of 16 robbery-related charges and sentenced to almost four years in prison. After credit for time served before sentencing, Ryan was granted full parole in late 2010.
“You remain a low risk for offending,” the parole board said.
He filed for bankruptcy after his release.
He attempted to revive his house painting business, but failed. Who wants a convicted thief in their house, right?
“As he approached his 30th birthday, he couldn’t escape the self-inflicted realities of his life: he was a bankrupt ex-con with a high school education and no prospects,” wrote Mark Mann for Toronto Life.
In 2011, Brett met Kristen Baxter through a friend and, January 2013, moved into her waterfront condo.
While Kristen knew about his criminal record, she didn’t know he lied about his job and education.
Instead, Brett Ryan told his fiance he graduated from university in 2016 and worked in IT. The job in IT was true, but only for a month or so until his employer learned of Brett’s criminal record. He was fired immediately but concealed the job loss from his fiance.
About a month before the couple’s planned wedding day, Brett Ryan broke down and confessed the truth to his mother.
She demanded he tell his wife-to-be or she would tell Kristen for him.
“Brett Ryan was worried that if his fiancee discovered the web of lies, she’d call off the wedding,” said Justice John McMahon.
It was his mother’s threat to expose these lies a month before his planned marriage that led to the triple-murder.
From the Toronto Sun’s July 29, 2017, column Crossbow killer Brett Ryan murdered family to hide his deceit:
The tension mounted in the days leading up to the killings as Ryan couldn’t land a job.
He confronted his mother. When their argument became heated, she phoned his older brother, Christopher, for help.
Brett retrieved the crossbow, stabbed his mom with a bolt, then strangled her to death with a yellow nylon rope.
Brett ambushed Christopher by shooting a bolt through the back of his head when he appeared.
Brett hid both bodies under a tarp in the garage. His younger brother, Alexander, was fatally stabbed with a bolt when he confronted Brett.
[Youngest brother] Leigh, who lived with his mother, heard the commotion and saw Brett standing over Alexander, who collapsed in the driveway.
Leigh raced inside to phone for help. Brett attacked him immediately, but Leigh managed to escape and phone for help from a neighbour’s home.
When police officers arrived, Ryan confessed.
I’ll close with the comments of a Reddit user.
He’s scared his fiancé will call off the wedding because he told tall tales……. so he kills his family? Surely THAT won’t spur her to call off the wedding, right? What logic.
What logic indeed.
