In another brazen daylight shooting two South Asian male members were shot at the Sundial Boutique Hotel, located in the 4300 block of Sundial Crescent, Whistler, B.C. on July 24th.The police later identified the victims of shooting as Satindera Gill and Meninder Dhaliwal who according to IHTI, “were both known to police.” “This is believed to have been a targeted shooting, in relation to the ongoing Lower Mainland gang conflict,” informed Sergeant Timothy Pierotti of IHIT.According to various media reports Meninder Dhaliwal was “Brothers Keepers” gang member. Dhaliwal’s younger brother Harb was shot in Vancouver’s Coal Harbour area last year in a targeted hit. In 2021, Meninder Dhaliwal’s name was on the list of VPD’s top 6 gangsters with links to Vancouver “who posed a significant risk to the safety of the public.”Video of the gruesome aftermath went viral that showed Dhaliwal, wearing a white T-shirt and shorts and an over the shoulder satchel, face down in the hotel parking lot, in a pool of blood.Gill was seen splayed out on the other side of a parked white BMW where a bystander appears to be trying to aid him, the video shows.Dhaliwal died at the scene and Gill was rushed to an area hospital where he succumbed to his gunshot wounds.The community around Whistler Mountain, home of the 2010 Winter Olympics, was temporarily locked down by the RCMP. However police declared the area risk free later. “I’m confident with the work done by our investigators that there remains no risk to community safety,” said Inspector Robert Dykstra, Officer in Charge of the Sea to Sky RCMP.One victim died on scene, while the other died as a result of injuries, a short time later after being transported to hospital.A burning vehicle believed to be associated to the shooting was located in the 3300 block of Ptarmigan Place, in Whistler, B.C.Sea-to-Sky RCMP were able to locate and apprehend multiple individuals. The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) took conduct of the investigation and in partnership with the Sea-to-Sky Whistler RCMP.On July 25, 2022, following a consultation with BC Prosecution Service, charges of first-degree murder were approved against 24-year-old Gursimran Sahota, from Surrey and 20-year-old Tanvir Khakh, from Surrey.“This act was outrageous and shock to the visitors and community of Whistler,” said Sergeant David Lee of IHIT, “these results are thanks to the real-time information provided and the quick actions of the First Responders.”Three other individuals were arrested along with Khakh and Sahota. The extent of their involvement is still being determined. This investigation is still ongoing.Anyone with information is asked to contact the IHIT Information Line at 1-877-551-IHIT (4448) or by email at [email protected].Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp  Previous article2 young men arrested and charged in shooting of Ripudaman Singh MalikNext articleLangley would have been another Portapique, if there was no emergency alert on the day of deadly shootingTeam Link RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORDemocratisation of technology important tool to help bridge data divide: PM Modi at G20 Development Ministers’ meet‘My sisters picked up by police’: Imran Khan amid tussle with Pakistan govtWho is Alexander Soros?

In another brazen daylight shooting two South Asian male members were shot at the Sundial Boutique Hotel, located in the 4300 block of Sundial Crescent, Whistler, B.C. on July 24th.The police later identified the victims of shooting as Satindera Gill and Meninder Dhaliwal who according to IHTI, “were both known to police.” “This is believed to have been a targeted shooting, in relation to the ongoing Lower Mainland gang conflict,” informed Sergeant Timothy Pierotti of IHIT.According to various media reports Meninder Dhaliwal was “Brothers Keepers” gang member. Dhaliwal’s younger brother Harb was shot in Vancouver’s Coal Harbour area last year in a targeted hit. In 2021, Meninder Dhaliwal’s name was on the list of VPD’s top 6 gangsters with links to Vancouver “who posed a significant risk to the safety of the public.”Video of the gruesome aftermath went viral that showed Dhaliwal, wearing a white T-shirt and shorts and an over the shoulder satchel, face down in the hotel parking lot, in a pool of blood.Gill was seen splayed out on the other side of a parked white BMW where a bystander appears to be trying to aid him, the video shows.Dhaliwal died at the scene and Gill was rushed to an area hospital where he succumbed to his gunshot wounds.The community around Whistler Mountain, home of the 2010 Winter Olympics, was temporarily locked down by the RCMP. However police declared the area risk free later. “I’m confident with the work done by our investigators that there remains no risk to community safety,” said Inspector Robert Dykstra, Officer in Charge of the Sea to Sky RCMP.One victim died on scene, while the other died as a result of injuries, a short time later after being transported to hospital.A burning vehicle believed to be associated to the shooting was located in the 3300 block of Ptarmigan Place, in Whistler, B.C.Sea-to-Sky RCMP were able to locate and apprehend multiple individuals.
