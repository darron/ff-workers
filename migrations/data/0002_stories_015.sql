Spree Killer’s Last Victim
December 23, 2021May 20, 1996 by Sawyer Cowley
Police investigation in laneway, photo by Moira Welsh
Thirty-one-year-old Deanna (Thomas) Wilkinson was the last victim of spree killer Marcello Palma, who killed three prostitutes within just a few hours on Victoria Day weekend, May 20, 1996.
Wilkinson was also a songstress who had performed at various venues, and was a poetess and short story writer. The Sex Workers Alliance of Toronto held a 150-person vigil in Allan Gardens on behalf of all victims.
Wilkinson was shot with a .357 Sturm Ruger owned by Palma, just minutes after he murdered 19-year-old Shawn Keegan on the same street. Palma had murdered Brenda Ludgate, 25, about two hours previously. Palma used Supreme Expanding Talon hollow point bullets, which inflict more damage than a regular bullet.

Palma had become enraged earlier in the day and had damaged cars and his office just hours before starting his spree. Palma legally owned six guns. His wife would later testify that he struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts and that even though she called his psychiatrist out of concern, she was told Palma had “not much wrong” with him. He had been seeking psychiatric help for at least five years.
Palma had admitted to a psychiatrist that he wanted to kill street people, whom he called “scum.” He was familiar with Homewood Avenue, then a well-known strip for finding trans prostitutes referred to as “Transvestite Alley”. After killing Keegan, Palma walked up Homewood Avenue, and found Wilkinson. The combination of Victoria Day fireworks and a thunderstorm may have covered the noise of the gunshots that killed Keegan.
Wilkinson was not found until 9am the next morning, shot in the head. Palma remained in Toronto for about a week before fleeing to Halifax, where police tracked him through the use of a credit card.

In court, heard before a judge only, Palma’s claim of insanity was denied. On April 20, 2001, Palma was sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder with no eligibility for parole for 25 years.

Spree Killer Victim Dead At 19
May 25, 2022May 20, 1996 by Sawyer Cowley
Murder victim Shawn Keegan (wearing cap) at a BBQ, photo by Peter Power
Shawn Keegan was just 19 years old when they was murdered by Toronto spree killer Marcello Palma. Keegan, described as a “transvestite prostitute”, was killed with the same gun as “female prostitute” Brenda Ludgate, 25, and “transsexual prostitute” Deanna (Thomas) Wilkinson, 31, within about three hours, on May 20, 1996.
Keegan had lived for some time with a dozen other squatters in a vacant building, but had been evicted about 2 weeks earlier.
Palma, 33, a married man with a child, was arrested in Halifax about two weeks after spree. He admitted killing all three people, but claimed he was not criminally responsible at the time.
On the day of the spree, Palma became irate, trashed his business office and took a hammer to the cars of co-workers. He also played golf with friends (but left angry) and visited his parents.
Keegan, who was dressed as a woman at the time of their death, was pushed down some stairs and shot in the head. Realizing Keegan was not dead, Palma shot again. Residents of the apartment building notified security, who found Keegan still alive. However, they died shortly thereafter.

Palma then went on to kill Wilkinson very shortly afterwards. Palma remained in Toronto for about a week before fleeing to Halifax, where police tracked him through the use of a credit card.
Toronto homicide Det. Sgt. Jim McDermott called Palma a “spree killer and a serial killer.” In court, heard before a judge only, Palma’s claim of insanity was denied. On April 20, 2001, Palma was sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder with no eligibility for parole for 25 years.

Pierre Lebrun and the 1999 OC Transpo Murders
Published April 4, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Guns, Suicide
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.

On April 6, 1999, at approximately 2:30 p.m., Pierre Lebrun drove into the parking lot of OC Transpo’s St. Laurent Boulevard garage and parked near the supervisor’s office.
He walked inside the building, a Remington Model 760 pump-action rifle in hand, and reportedly yelled, “It’s Judgement Day!” then fired his first round.
The bullet travelled through a steel drum, then a metal locker before fragments hit two men, Richard Guertin and Joe Casagrande. Both injuries were minor and the men ran down a hallway, yelling for someone to call 911.
An announcement went out over the building’s public address system and many of the 150 employees either ran from the building or hid wherever they could. Others thought it was a bad joke and remained in place.
Lebrun followed the two men down the hallway where he shot and killed his first victim, Brian Guay.
He moved through the building and killed Harry Schoenmakers, then made his way to a store room where he killed Clare Davidson and David Lemay.
Finally, he moved upstairs to a loft overlooking the engine room and killed himself.
Like Gamil Gharbi ten years prior, Lebrun’s pockets were filled with ammunition when he committed suicide.
Also like Gharbi, Lebrun carried a list of people he hated and, presumably, wanted dead, along with the names of three people who tried to help him. Nobody on Lebrun’s list were injured or killed.
In less than thirty minutes from the time he entered the OC Transport facility to the time he took his own life, he killed four people. He also spared the lives of at least six others. Nobody knows why he allowed some to live and killed others.
“It’s very curious as to why he selected certain individuals to kill and permitted certain people to live. He could easily have killed many more people,” said Ottawa-Carleton Regional Police Inspector Ian Davidson.
Police investigators and reporters quickly filled in the blanks about Pierre Lebrun’s life.
What they discovered was a man with a stammer who was bullied from early childhood, a quiet man who struggled with depression.
During the 1996 transit strike, Pierre Lebrun went on sick leave rather than walk the picket line with his fellow workers. Despite advice from his doctor, Lebrun was taunted mercilessly by other employees and, in 1997, he punched a co-worker in the face for making fun of him.
OC Transpo fired him, but was forced to re-hire him after the union intervened on Lebrun’s behalf.
Three months before the shooting, Lebrun quit work and headed west to British Columbia, then south to Las Vegas. He lost his severance pay gambling and drove back to Ottawa just before going on his killing spree.
He left a suicide note in his parents’ home.
The most shocking revelation came during the coroner’s inquest, however.
One OC Transpo employee hanged himself about two months after the shooting. In his suicide note, the man admitted knowing about Lebrun’s murderous plans but never reported it.
“Pierre had talked with me at great length about it and where to be for the better shot at the managers… I feel guilty as hell for not telling anyone. Who was I to know if he’d do it or not?”
The autopsy on Pierre Lebrun revealed he was high on marijuana at the time of the murders.

1999 School Shooting

The W. R. Myers High School shooting was a school shooting that occurred on April 28, 1999, at W. R. Myers High School in Taber, Alberta, Canada. The gunman, 14-year-old school dropout Todd Cameron Smith, walked into his school and began firing at  students in a hallway, then went to the central hub of the school in front of the band room, killed one student and wounded another one. It was the first fatal high-school shooting in Canada since the St. Pius X High School shooting, 24 years earlier.
Shooting[edit]
The incident began when Smith entered the school campus armed with a .22-caliber Ruger 10/22 semi-automatic rifle and 375 rounds of ammunition (350 rounds of live ammunition in his coat pocket and 25 rounds loaded into the rifle).[citation needed] As lunch concluded, he fired at three students in a hallway adjacent to the cafeteria. He fatally shot 17-year-old Jason Lang at point-blank range, and then shot at one other student. Gym coach Cheyno Finnie managed to wrestle Smith to the floor. He was arrested without further incident by a Taber constable, who also served as the school&#39;s resource officer.[1] He was charged with one count of first-degree murder, and two counts of attempted murder.[2]
Aftermath[edit]
Legal proceedings[edit]
Smith&#39;s identity and background were originally protected under Canada&#39;s Young Offenders Act at the time of his arrest.[3] He had dropped out of W.R. Myers High School earlier in the school year. According to court documents, he had suffered severe bullying throughout his school years, including having been doused with lighter fluid and threatened to be set alight when he was in the first grade.[4] He was remembered as being intelligent but socially awkward, and had become &#34;reclusive and extremely fearful&#34;[4] by early adolescence.  His mother said he had been showing signs of depression throughout his childhood.[3] Smith&#39;s family stated that he &#34;snapped&#34; after watching coverage of the Columbine High School massacre, which had occurred eight days prior.[4]
Crown prosecutors attempted to have then 15-year-old Smith tried as an adult with the potential for a life sentence with the possibility of parole in five years. The Crown argued that an adult prison would offer greater educational programs than a youth facility could provide.  The court denied the motion and he was tried as a juvenile.[4]
Following his arrest and before the trial, a medical examination discovered Smith had a heart ailment that required open heart surgery. During the surgery, he suffered a stroke and fell into a coma. After awakening from the coma, he had speaking and eating difficulties and suffered from diminished mental capacity. His case was suspended until he recovered, as both the Crown and defense agreed he could not stand trial.[5] Following a &#34;remarkable recovery&#34;, he was declared suitable to stand trial, and was scheduled to appear in court in September 2000.[6] At his trial, Smith pleaded guilty to all three charges, and was sentenced to three years in prison, and was ordered to live seven years on probation upon his release.[4]
Smith&#39;s release, second arrest[edit]
In March 2005, Todd Cameron Smith was released into a halfway house in Toronto, despite the agreement of the judge that the then 20-year-old remained a threat to society.[2] In August of that year, he walked out of the halfway house, leaving behind a note reading, &#34;I can&#39;t be caged any more. If they find me, they&#39;ll have to kill me. I will never be caged again. Bye. Sorry.&#34;[7] His escape prompted Toronto police to obtain a court injunction allowing them to publicize his identity until such time as he was caught.[2]
However, Smith turned himself in to authorities the following day and was arrested without incident. The waiver allowing the publication of his identity in Canada lapsed upon his recapture, though not before his name was published and released by several news outlets across the country. Following his recapture, Canadian media were required to no longer use Smith&#39;s name or photograph, as they had the previous day.

Shannon Cruse: Murdered by an Abusive Ex-Boyfriend with a Smuggled Handgun
Published June 12, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.
There is no such thing as a “simple” mass murder case.
Every one of the events chronicled in my series on Canadian Mass Murders tells a completely different story, even if the underlying cause – the utter depravity of man – is the same.
Some mass murders take on lives of their own, driven by political activists with agendas.
Others, like the 2002 murders of Shannon Cruse, her 6-year-old daughter Shaniya and her parents, Mary and Donald Cruse, are seemingly forgotten.
As I searched for news stories about the Cruse family murders, I was struck by how little information I could find. It wasn’t until I dug deep inside newspaper archives from 2002 that Shannon Cruse’s tragic story began to unfold.
Even then, the only article I could find written about this family beyond 2002 was written by an ex-cop who, for reasons eerily similar to mine, published his writeup of this tragic story on the 10th anniversary of the murders.
Hopefully, something in my exploration of this case will inspire you to remember Shannon Cruse and her family each June 14th with me.
Cruse Family History
Donald Cruse, Shannon’s father, built Wreckmaster, a world-class towing and tow-truck driver training company. His expertise made him a legend in the industry and he trained tow truck drivers around the world. Cruse also founded the Canadian Towing Society.
Shannon Cruse worked for her father as his business manager.
Mary Cruse, Don’s wife, was a retired teacher and a devout member of St. Joseph’s Church. In retirement, she volunteered at her grand-daughter’s school to teach the children how to read.
When Shannon attended a tow-truck convention in Lafayette, North Carolina, in 2000, she met Peter Kiss, a tow-truck owner from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They began dating, got engaged and, in January 2002, Shannon and her daughter moved to Milwaukee to live with Peter.
Here Shannon discovered Peter’s physically and verbally abusive nature. Shannon dealt with it as best she could until he directed his verbal abuse at her 6-year-old daughter Shaniya.
She refused to tolerate anyone abusing her child.
In April, 2002, afraid for both her safety and her daughter’s, Shannon Cruse broke off the relationship with Peter Kiss just two months after moving to Milwaukee.
She took her daughter and fled back across the border to Grimsby, Ontario, where Shannon and her daughter moved into a house down the road from her parents. Once back in the safety of her home town, she revealed to family and friends just how terrified she was of her ex-fiance.
“It was a nasty breakup,” said Virginia Danihel, a friend of Shannon’s. “She told us if we ever saw Kiss’s vehicle, a burgundy GMC Yukon, we should call the police right away.”

The Cruse Family Murders
On Friday afternoon, June 14, 2002, tow-truck driver Peter Kiss left his home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, crossed the border into Ontario with a smuggled Glock .45 calibre handgun.
Once across the border, he parked his vehicle in Niagara Falls and rented a Ford Taurus with Canadian plates, probably so his terrified ex-girlfriend wouldn’t see him coming.
Then he drove to the small town of Grimbsy, Ontario, and hunted his ex-girlfriend down.
At roughly 9:20 p.m. on Friday, June 14, 2002, two gunshots rang out.
Shannon Cruse dropped to the ground in her driveway as two .45 calibre bullets tore through her body.
Police and ambulance attendants rushed her to the hospital where they tried to resuscitate the 23-year-old woman’s life. She succumbed to her injuries was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital.
Shannon’s murder was only the beginning of the Cruse family nightmare, however.
After killing her, Shannon’s angry ex-fiance went down the road to Shannon’s parents’ home. He kicked in the door, herded Shannon’s father into the master bedroom where her mother and daughter lay in bed.
He shot and killed all three then, like these cowards almost always do, Peter Kiss killed himself minutes before Niagara Regional Police officers arrived.
Justin Cruse, Shannon’s brother, only learned about the murders when returned home later that night. He screamed uncontrollably as his grief and anguish tore him apart.
Ken Cruse, Donald’s brother, broke down and wept while reading a prepared statement for the media.
“I’m devastated. I still haven’t come to grips with it. You never think something like this is going to strike so close to home,” he said.

A Green-Ribbon Funeral
On Saturday, June 22, 2002, four members of the Cruse family were laid to rest at St. Joseph’s Church in Grimsby, Ontario.
“Last Friday evening the tranquility of this town was shattered by the violent deaths of Don, Mary-Helen, Shannon and Shaniya Cruse,” said Reverend Hugh Gibson to a church filled with tearful mourners. “In a sense, Grimsby, lots its innocence last Friday and was touched by the unthinkable.”
Pallbearers for Donald Cruse wore grass-green overalls with the Wreckmaster’s logo, the towing company he ran. Other pallbearers and mourners wore green ribbons to honour the family.
“He wore green coveralls all the time,” said Al Valk Jr., owner of a Walden, New York towing company. “Green was his color. That’s why we’re doing the green ribbons.”
Outside the church, hundreds of tow trucks from across the region, some from as far away as Ohio and Pennsylvania, lined the streets to honour the slain family members.
“If every family was as loving and as caring as the Cruse family, the world would be a better place,” said Ron Fluke in his eulogy to his best friend, Donald Cruse.

Memory Box Created in Honour of 6-year-old Shaniya Cruse
From the National Post, Tuesday, June 18, 2002.
Shaniya Cruse’s classmates spent yesterday afternoon making a memory box in honour of the slain six-year-old.
Inside the decorated container went pictures and poems, prayers and cards, any small reminder of Shaniya’s life.
The youngster was killed on Friday night along with her mother, Shannon, and grandparents, Don and Mary Helen Cruse.
“It’s a concrete way for the children to contribute,” said Our Lady of Fatima principal Lisa Selman. “We broke the day down into reflection, prayer and memories.”
The memory box will be given to Justin Cruse, Shannon’s 20-year-old brother, who arrived at his family’s home after the killings.

Quadruple Homicide Changes to Border Security
When Peter Kiss travelled from Wisconsin to Grimsby, Ontario, with a smuggled handgun and a homicidal heart, he put a spotlight on the need for better border security.
In particular, the fact Kiss was able to smuggle a handgun across the Rainbow Bridge port of entry into Canada, despite the implementation of post-9/11 enhanced border screening procedures, left many baffled.
“Despite everything that has been said, the government has not done enough to ensure that smuggled firearms are stopped at the border,” said Ontario NDP leader Howard Hampton. “We know the largest threat of firearms in Canada is from [illegally] imported firearms.”
The Grimsby murders highlighted the fact that while customs officials will pull over people with criminal records for extra screening, restraining orders are not included in their databases.
In September, 1999, Zsuzsanna Torgyik, Peter Kiss’s ex-girlfriend, took out a restraining order against him. Court records showed Peter Kiss pushed Ms. Torgyik out of a flatbed truck, choked her, slapped her in front of her son, lifted her by her neck and threatened to take her son away.
Torguik sought and was issued a temporary restraining order against Peter Kiss in 1999, and not long afterward he met Shannon Cruse and focused his obsession on her.
His history of stalking and threatening ex-lovers is information Canada’s border guards should have been aware of, said Canadian Alliance MP John Reynolds.
“The minister himself said today that there was a mistake made. Anybody in the States who has a record or a restraining order against them should be on a computer. There should have been a second interview [of Peter Kiss]. That didn’t happen. Obviously there was a foul-up,” Reynolds said, referring to comments made by Immigration Minister Denis Coderre.
“We have got to make sure that the borders have the proper amounts of money, the proper training, to stop this [murderers from entering the country].”
While it wasn’t done in time to save the Cruse family, eventually most of Reynolds’ border security recommendations were implemented.

Peter Kiss was our primary towing provider for a body shop that I operated a few years prior to his murderous rampage, and looking back, he was a walking time bomb; his personality was very abrasive &amp; controlling though he tried to cover it up with a veneer of false kindness.
