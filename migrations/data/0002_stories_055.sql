Community leaders in the northwest Edmonton neighbourhood where two police officers were shot and killed in the line of duty on Thursday say growing concerns about violence in the city need to be addressed.
“The gun violence is concerning to me and it’s something that I’ve brought up to council before,” said Coun. Erin Rutherford, who represents Ward Anirniq, which the Inglewood neighbourhood is located in.Early Thursday morning, the Edmonton Police Service confirmed two constables were shot at an apartment building when they responded to a domestic violence call. They were taken to hospital where they were declared dead.READ MORE: 2 Edmonton police officers shot and killed: ‘Unthinkable and horrific tragedy’Global News has confirmed that the suspect gunman is a teen.

‘Unthinkable and horrific tragedy’: Edmonton police chief responds to fatal shooting of 2 officers
She noted that even though this case may have stemmed from an isolated domestic violence issue, there are ripple effects throughout the community and city.“When stuff like this happens, harm is already done to the community — people’s sense of safety and security. No matter the circumstances of the tragedy, whether it’s domestic or gang violence or anything else, it still affects sense of security.”The deadly shooting occurred just days after a shooting at a pizzeria across the street from the Inglewood apartment building sent a man to hospital in critical condition.Rutherford noted that she has been concerned that as efforts are made to address growing concerns about violence in the city’s core, those concerns are increasingly spreading beyond the downtown.

READ MORE: Condolences pour in following shooting deaths of Edmonton police officersLast year, police said they had seen a 10 per cent increase in shootings in Edmonton compared to a year before. Just last month, EPS Chief Dale McFee spoke about his concerns regarding gun violence in the city, particularly as it relates to homemade firearms.READ MORE: Ghost guns a growing concern for Edmonton policeDaryle Niedermayer is the president of the Inglewood Community League. He told Global News his thoughts are with the officers and their loved ones.“Police have a very difficult job to do and you should never be shot for doing your lawful job,” he said. “Inglewood itself is a community of 8,000 residents. We’re a large neighbourhood with a lot of density and a lot of people, and some of them have issues and problems.									Story continues below advertisement
“This was in a high-density part of the neighbourhood which has 30-some apartment buildings.”Niedermayer said, overall, Inglewood is “a fairly safe neighbourhood.”

“We don’t have a lot of violence inside of our borders,” he said. “But things happen.”According to Niedermayer, the building in which the officers were killed is inhabited by many families, including many new citizens who arrived in Canada after leaving countries in which they felt unsafe.He said the community is working to provide support for those struggling with the trauma of what happened on Thursday, especially those whose mental well-being is already vulnerable from fleeing violence in their native countries.Linda Fjelsted lives in a nearby apartment building and told The Canadian Press she woke up Thursday morning when she heard the police activity.“I heard the yelling and the talking and the police telling people to get back (in) their apartments,” she said. “The police were very, very upset.“I felt like I was watching something on TV.”

Fjelsted said her building is mostly quiet and people take pride in taking care of their residences. She also said the area is full of people from different ethnic backgrounds.									Story continues below advertisement
“I like it here,” she said.“We need to really encourage people to find the supports that they need, whether that is their ethnic group, their family group or that’s the neighbours around them,” Niedermayer said, adding he and other communities hope to “create a sense where we know who our neighbours are.”“(Create a community where we) can reach out when we have a problem and we can have somebody say, ‘Listen, can I buy you a coffee? Can I sit down with you for a while and help you through this?&#39;”

Niedermayer said while he cannot speak to what led to any one act of violence in the city in recent months, he believes the COVID-19 pandemic and the public health restrictions that came with it have taken a toll on many people.“We felt alone I think for a couple of years,” he said. “And we need to realize that we don’t need to be alone as a people anymore.”READ MORE: Father-to-be and ‘snow angel’: Slain Edmonton officers Travis Jordan and Brett Ryan rememberedThe EPS has identified the officers who died as Const.

What type of parents allow their kid to misuse a firearm or did they even pay any attention to the mental state of their son? It would not seem so and it would suggest this young punk was a problem for some time. Parental inaction and apathy?

It would be nice to say this boy is an anomaly. But is he? How many isolated young people are there? Is there enough mental health help available? Does prolonged video game exposure contribute to this inability to deal with real life? We may never know. My heart goes out to all the victims in this senseless tragedy.

We still don&#39;t know anything about this individual . . .How did a Minor get a Handgun . . . how long have they lived at this address?Lots more we need to know . . .The Pizza Hut likely had Video Cameras . . . were the police too busy with &#34;tranny&#34; protests?Lots of questions . . . few answers . . . the Perp is deceased no longer a Minor to protect, it would be nice to know the whole story.

I agree. As usual there&#39;s a lot more to this story than we&#39;re being told and it&#39;s unlikely we will ever know the whole truth. My first suspicion is that he wasn&#39;t a licensed gun owner, or that would have been plastered all over the place by now.

How did he get a handgun? It’s Edmonton. If you can get cocaine you can also get a handgun. It’s more expensive than buying it legally, well, when you could get it legally, but they are available. And they have 16 in the magazine not 8.

Left Coast, you asked some valid questions but as usual &#34; The Police &#34; were likely as you say probably addressing &#34; tranny &#34; protests. Why didn&#39;t his mother know he had a gun..? Where is his father..? How long has this 16 year old been a problem And why are we still having this BS conversation about this &#34; YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT &#34;..? If you can do the crime you should do the time

From what I gather from this article, they weren&#39;t able to catch him. Had their been citizens in the Pizzeria with concealed carry licenses, the 2 officers killed today would be alive, and the kid would have already been on a slab.

By Omar MoslehStaff ReporterKieran LeavittStaff ReporterAlex BoydStaff ReporterFri., March 17, 2023timer4 min. readupdateArticle was updated Mar. 20, 2023EDMONTON—After two police officers were fatally shot, the teenager who’d fired at them struggled with his mother over the firearm before shooting her and, finally, turning the gun on himself, police say.In an update Friday afternoon, police provided new details on the deaths of Edmonton constables Travis Jordan, 35 and Brett Ryan, 30, who were gunned down in the early hours of Thursday after being called to a family dispute at an apartment in the city’s northwest. They were both shot multiple times by the 16-year-old male and “immediately incapacitated” before they could draw their own weapons. While the youth was known to police — but had never been charged with an offence — authorities say the officers had no indication that he had a gun that night.With both officers down, a struggle ensued between the youth and his 55-year-old mother over the firearm, police say. They say the son shot his mother before taking his own life. She remains in hospital in stable condition but remains unresponsive.The teen’s father, 73, was not injured and is co-operating with police, authorities said.On day two of the investigation, major questions remained. Police have not named any of the residents of the suite where the incident took place. They have also declined to say what kind of gun was used, or how a teen had ended up with a firearm at all — “certainly, there’s just way too many guns in our city right now,” Devin Laforce, deputy chief of the EPS Investigations Bureau, told media.The youth had multiple non-criminal interactions with police, including a mental health complaint, but police said they didn’t have any further details. Because he died in the presence of police, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team will be overseeing the investigation.Questions have also been raised about a shooting last week at a small Pizza Hut sandwiched between a jeweller and pharmacy less than a kilometre away from the apartment complex, in which a man shot an employee, seriously injuring him, then fled. A suspect was never identified and some media reports said Friday it was the same 16-year-old. While police told the media briefing they were investigating a link, for now they are being treated as two separate investigations, authorities said.“I don’t have any knowledge to say that that person came up at all regarding any of those crimes in that area,” Laforce said.During a busy lunch hour, a manager told the Star the employee that was shot last Sunday was recovering and stable. A person who was identified as the owner later arrived and told reporters he was not able to provide any more information on the incident. Pizza Hut’s media line did not respond to a request for comment by publication time. On Friday, officers were milling in and out of the apartment building where the violent incident had occurred, as several police cruisers and a forensic truck were parked outside of the building that was still encircled in police tape.Residents cautiously avoided the tape as small puddles formed on the ground from the melted snow. At one point, a woman and her family approached a police truck to offer coffee and doughnuts — she said they were not from the area, but appreciated the efforts of police in keeping Edmontonians safe. “In times like these putting on the uniform is no easy task,” Laforce said. “Reminders of constables Jordan and Ryan are everywhere. But our members have an unwavering sense of duty and dedication to Edmontonians and the safety of our city.”The shooting — the first killing of an Edmonton officer since 2015 — has stunned the Alberta capital. City landmarks, including city hall, the High Level Bridge, Muttart Conservatory, Commonwealth Stadium and the Walterdale Bridge were all lit with blue lights Thursday night in honour of the two officers, and flags at the legislature, government buildings and police detachments have been lowered to half mast. RELATED STORIESCanada‘My son, he wants to kill me’: Edmonton residents stunned after police officers fatally shot responding to family disputeMar. 16, 2023Condolence books were set up Friday at Edmonton City Hall for people to pay their respects. Online fundraisers have been organized for the families of the officers by the Edmonton Police Association and the Alberta Paramedic Association. The two officers reached the apartment building in Edmonton’s Inglewood neighbourhood just before 1 a.m. Thursday and were shot shortly after approaching the suite, police say. One of them was bundled into a police cruiser and taken to hospital by his own colleagues, while the other was transported in an ambulance to the hospital where both were pronounced dead. Autopsies for the two officers will be done this weekend, while the youth is scheduled for next Wednesday.Jordan, originally from Nova Scotia, had been an officer for eight and a half years. He has been remembered for his kindness — including during the early months of the pandemic, when he offered to help a woman clear the snow off her car instead of ticketing her, in a moment that was caught on camera and widely shared online, earning him the nickname the “snow angel.”Ryan was a longtime minor hockey referee and former paramedic who was described by one friend as “wired” to help others. He was about to become a father.With files from The Canadian PressRead more about: Edmonton, AlbertaSHARE:Report an errorJournalistic StandardsAbout The StarJOIN THE CONVERSATION Q:Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder.
