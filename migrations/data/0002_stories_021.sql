The 2014 Saint Jean sur Richelieu ramming attack was a terror car ramming that occurred in Quebec on October 20, 2014. Two Canadian Forces members were hit by a lone wolf terrorist, Martin Couture-Rouleau. Warrant officer Patrice Vincent died from injuries, while another soldier was injured, but survived. The RCMP and the Government of Canada has characterized the homicide as a terrorist act by an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-inspired terrorist.[1]
Attack and pursuit[edit]
On October 20, 2014, Martin Couture-Rouleau deliberately rammed a car into a pair of Canadian Armed Forces soldiers in a shopping centre parking lot in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, Canada, at 11:30 a.m. ET. He had been seen sitting in his car and watching for over two hours before the attack.[2] A police chase ensued. The Toronto Sun reported that the suspect called 911 during the chase to say that he carried out his acts in the name of Allah.[3]
The chase ended when Martin Couture-Rouleau lost control of his car, rolling it into a ditch and onto its roof. A witness said that a spike belt was deployed. According to witnesses, Couture-Rouleau exited the car and charged a female police officer with a knife.[3] Police shot him up to seven times and he was pronounced dead that evening in hospital.[3]  A large knife was seen stuck in the ground according to eyewitnesses.[4]
There were two victims. Warrant officer Patrice Vincent (53) died in hospital the next day while another unnamed soldier sustained non-life-threatening injures.[5] One of the soldiers was in uniform and one was not.[3]
A statement by Prime Minister Stephen Harper indicated that government and police officials linked the attack to terrorism.[6][7]
Victims[edit]
Warrant officerPatrice VincentBornJuly 19, 1961DiedOctober 21, 2014 (age 53)Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, QuebecAllegiance CanadaRankWarrant officer
Warrant officer Patrice Vincent, 53, had served in the military for 28 years and was considering retiring to become a cabinet maker.[8] He had previously served as a refrigeration and mechanical technician engineer as well as a military firefighter.[2] Vincent&#39;s funeral was held on November 1, 2014.[8][9]
A second Canadian Forces member was injured in the attack.
Perpetrator[edit]
Martin Couture-Rouleau (died October 20, 2014, age 25) was a francophone Canadian living with his parents in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu at the time of the attack. He was separated from his partner and their young child. Couture-Rouleau had converted to Islam in the previous year, and was praying at a mosque &#34;regularly.&#34;[10] He had owned a small power-washing business that failed.[11]
Legal documents show Couture-Rouleau became a Muslim convert in 2013 and started to refer to himself as Ahmad LeConverti (Ahmad the Converted).[2] Facebook activity and a CBC interview show that he had become a supporter of ISIL. He posted images and links that were anti-American foreign policy, and links to anti-Semitic YouTube videos. Global reported Facebook posts in both English and French about Allah and graphic posters with references to Islam&#39;s superiority over Christianity.[12] A Facebook friend who corresponded with Couture-Rouleau said, &#34;So he was really mad that Canada actually supported the American bombing of [ISIS] in Syria and Iraq so I think that was the main motive in killing that Canadian soldier.&#34;[13][14] Another told Radio-Canada that Couture-Rouleau spent hours on the internet and devoured jihadist literature, and that Couture-Rouleau dreamed of dying as a martyr.[13]
According to information Radio-Canada obtained, he had convinced at least four or five people in his circle of friends to convert to Islam, but the friend said that Couture-Rouleau got carried away with an extreme interpretation of the Qur&#39;an.[13] A friend said he was obsessed with practicing his new religion and trying to convert his friends.[12]
The RCMP became aware of Couture-Rouleau after a relative alerted police to the man&#39;s terrorist leanings.[3] He wanted to travel to Iraq to fight with ISIL the summer before he perpetrated the attack in Quebec.[11][15] His Canadian passport was revoked in June 2014 over concerns that he had &#34;become radicalized after converting to Islam.&#34;[2] RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson confirmed he was one of 90 Canadians under surveillance[13] by the RCMP because they were suspected of wanting to join terrorist organizations.[16]
Responses[edit]
The federal government immediately labelled the act as a terrorist attack. According to Steven Blaney, Canadian Minister of Public Safety, the attack was &#34;clearly linked to terrorist ideology.&#34;[17] The Prime Minister&#39;s office released a statement that said in part &#34;The individual who struck the two CAF members with his car is known to federal authorities, including the Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams (the Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams are an anti-terrorism police unit). Federal authorities have confirmed that there are clear indications that the individual had become radicalized.&#34;[12]
After the 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa, Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave a nationally televised address in which he said &#34;Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent... was killed earlier this week by an ISIL-inspired terrorist&#34; and &#34;this week&#39;s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world. We are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governance are by their very nature, attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all.&#34;[1] Conservative MP Erin O&#39;Toole said on Power Play that he stands behind the terrorist act label, both in the case of Zehaf-Bibeau and Martin Couture-Rouleau. &#34;Warrant Officer Vincent and Nathan Cirillo weren&#39;t attacked for who they were, they were attacked for what their uniform represented, so inherently that&#39;s terrorism.&#34;[18]
Rouleau&#39;s next-door neighbour said, &#34;Mr. Rouleau&#39;s father, Gilles, is a peaceful man who tried to help his troubled son. She said Mr. Rouleau had been &#34;brainwashed&#34; by online radicals. &#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a terrorist act,&#34; she said. &#34;He needed help. We could see that he needed psychiatric help.&#34;[19] &#34;To convert to a new religion and to adopt such violent, radical ideology suggests that he was influenced by others, in person or online,&#34; said Wagdy Loza, head of the Canadian Psychological Association&#39;s extremism and terrorism section.[20]
In an article on The Daily Beast website, Jacob Siegel equated both Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau, &#34;the killers who brought terror to Canada this week&#34;, with the 2014 New York City hatchet attacker, saying &#34;like the killers who brought terror to Canada this week, the New York attacker is being called a &#34;lone wolf&#34;, meaning he acted essentially on his own, [Couture-Rouleau and Zehab-Bibeau] seem custom made for the stray dog profile, and the kind of terrorist the West could be seeing a lot more of in the future&#34;. He cites a paper by Brian Michael Jenkins of the RAND Corporation. Jenkins described them as &#34;stray dogs,&#34; rather than lone wolves, characterizing them as &#34;misfits&#34; who are &#34;who are moved from seething anger to spontaneous deadly action&#34; by exposure to Islamist propaganda.[21]
Media reactions[edit]
Commentators have cited the attacks against Canadian soldiers in Quebec and Ottawa while arguing against Canadian Government changes to anti-terrorism legislation, although the legislation was prepared long before the attacks occurred and is not in response specifically to the two attacks.
James Baxter, editor-in-chief of ipolitics.ca, an Ottawa political zine, said &#34;the government is exploiting two isolated murders to push through sweeping new surveillance powers&#34; and pointed out &#34;the would-be &#39;terrorists&#39; involved were armed only with a car and a vintage hunting rifle&#34;.[22]
Andre Picard, in an opinion piece for The Globe and Mail, acknowledged the Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were both attracted to radical elements in Islam, and dismissed arguments that mental illness caused their actions.[23]
Vincent and Nathan Cirillo, the victim in the Ottawa shootings, were jointly named the Canadian Newsmakers of the Year by the Canadian Press.[24]

Terrorist attacks in Ottawa, Canada

The 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill were a series of shootings that occurred on October 22, 2014, at Parliament Hill in Ottawa. At the National War Memorial, Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier and reservist on ceremonial sentry duty, was fatally shot by mentally unwell [7] Islamic terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. Zehaf-Bibeau then entered the nearby Centre Block parliament building, where members of the Parliament of Canada were attending caucuses. After wrestling with a constable at the entrance, Zehaf-Bibeau ran inside and had a shootout with RCMP officers. He was shot 31 times by six officers and died on scene.[8][9][10] Following the shootings, the downtown core of Ottawa was placed on lockdown and majority of schools in Ottawa were on lockdown while police searched for any potential additional threats.[11][2][12]
The attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was a 32-year-old Canadian habitual offender and addiction patient from Montreal. He had been observed by acquaintances exhibiting erratic behaviour.  At the time of the shooting, Zehaf-Bibeau planned to leave Canada for the Middle East and was living in a homeless shelter in Ottawa while waiting for the processing of his Canadian passport application. According to RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson the &#34;passport issue was central to what was driving&#34; Zehaf-Bibeau.[13]
Zehaf-Bibeau made a video prior to the attack in which he expressed his desire to &#34;kill some soldiers&#34; and his motives as being related &#34;to Canada&#39;s foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs.&#34;[14] To acquaintances and co-workers, he had previously expressed support for jihadists and others in the Middle East resisting the West&#39;s intervention, but was not known to the police to be a terrorism risk. In his mother&#39;s opinion, the attack was the &#34;last desperate act&#34; of someone with a mental disorder who felt trapped.[15] Canadian Muslim organizations condemned the attack.[16]
Classified by the RCMP as a terrorist act under the Criminal Code,[2][17] it was the most serious security breach at Parliament Hill since the 1966 parliament bombing.[18] It took place two days after a man used his car to run over two soldiers in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, killing one. The two incidents, which attracted international attention, raised concerns about the effectiveness of police actions to prevent terrorist attacks, the prevention of radicalization and the security measures in place at federal and provincial legislatures.
The Canadian government had already prepared a bill to expand the courtroom anonymity and surveillance powers of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Canada&#39;s intelligence agency, which was due to be introduced the day of the shootings, and was postponed by the event. The government introduced new anti-terrorism measures with the Anti-terrorism Act, 2015.[19] Security at Parliament Hill is to be stepped up. On June 3, 2015, it was reported that &#34;RCMP officers have started openly carrying submachine guns on Parliament Hill as part of a visible increase to Parliament Hill security.&#34;[20]
Background[edit]
On October 20, in the 2014 Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu ramming attack, Martin Couture-Rouleau attacked two Canadian Armed Forces soldiers. Rouleau was a 25-year-old Québécois who became a Muslim convert in 2013[21] and was a supporter of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[22] Rouleau used his car to run over the two soldiers before being fatally shot by police after an ensuing car chase.[23] Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, age 53, subsequently died from injuries.[4]
The terror threat level in Canada was on October 21 raised to medium in light of the ramming attack and due to &#34;an increase in online &#39;general chatter&#39; from radical groups including Islamic State and al-Qaeda.&#34;[24] In his address to the nation following the shootings on October 22, Prime Minister Stephen Harper referred to the October 20 incident as an ISIL-inspired terrorist attack.[25] Although both the October 20 and 22 attacks led to the death of Canadian soldiers, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) ruled out any direct connection between the attacks of October 20 and 22.[26]
Shootings[edit]
National War Memorial[edit]
Nathan Cirillo was on sentry duty at the National War Memorial, similar to the sentries in this picture, when he was fatally shot.
Shortly before 10:00 a.m. EDT, on October 22, 2014, witnesses saw Zehaf-Bibeau arrive at the National War Memorial carrying a rifle, which was later identified as a .30–30 Winchester Model 94 lever-action hunting rifle.[27] He was dressed in blue jeans and a black jacket, with a keffiyeh scarf over the lower part of his face.[28][29] He approached Corporal Nathan Cirillo of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise&#39;s), a reserve infantry unit, who was one of three sentries from the Ceremonial Guard posted at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. At close range, Zehaf-Bibeau shot Cirillo twice in the back,[30] fatally wounding him. Cirillo, like all others who have stood sentry at the memorial, carried an unloaded firearm,[31] and had been provided by the CAF with no particular training for such a situation. It was only minutes before the end of the sentries&#39; shift, which ended at 10:00 a.m.[32] Cpl. Kyle Button and Cpl. Branden Stevenson, two other soldiers on sentry duty, attempted to stop Zehaf-Bibeau, but they were shot at by him and forced to flee to the other side of the Memorial.[32]
Zehaf-Bibeau then pulled down his scarf, held his rifle one-handedly over his head and yelled, &#34;For Iraq.&#34;[33] Cpl. Anthony Wiseman, who was nearby, then attempted to stop Zehaf-Bibeau, but Zehaf-Bibeau attempted to run him over.[32] The three soldiers then attended to Cirillo.[34] Along with bystanders, they applied first aid to Cirillo, attempting to resuscitate him, before Paramedic Chief Anthony DiMonte was first on scene, assumed patient care until additional paramedics arrived to provide medical care before Cirillo was taken to hospital.[32]
Meanwhile, Zehaf-Bibeau returned to his vehicle, a small grey Toyota car, which was parked on the south side of Wellington Street behind the memorial, and drove west along Wellington a short distance to Parliament Hill, where he abandoned his vehicle. Past scattering bystanders, he ran through a gate in the fence surrounding the Parliament Hill precinct and carjacked a parliamentary vehicle assigned to ministers of the Crown, which he drove to the Centre Block parliament building.[35] RCMP officers on patrol in the precinct witnessed the carjacking and pursued the vehicle to the base of the Peace Tower.[30]
A photograph of Zehaf-Bibeau was taken by a tourist at the war memorial during the shootings.[28] It shows him holding the rifle and wearing a scarf over part of his face, with part of the War Memorial behind him. Ottawa police seized the camera and then took their own photograph of the image using a cellphone. French-Canadian journalist William Reymond received a copy of the photograph via the Internet, anonymously, apparently a copy of a tweet originating from the Ottawa Police of the cellphone picture. Reymond then took a picture of the image as it was displayed on his computer monitor and posted it to Twitter a few hours later after confirming the image.[36] The image was re-tweeted by an ISIL sympathizer, leading to erroneous media reports that the image originated from an ISIL Twitter account.[28]
Parliament buildings[edit]
The Hall of Honour in the Centre Block, where Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was killed in an exchange of gunfire
Zehaf-Bibeau entered the Centre Block through the main entrance under the Peace Tower, where Samearn Son was one of two constables on duty. Son saw the rifle in Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s hand, immediately grabbed it, and pulled it towards the floor while yelling, &#34;Gun! Gun! Gun!&#34; In the ensuing struggle, Son was shot in the foot and had to let go of the attacker.[37] While other RCMP officers converged on Zehaf-Bibeau, Son limped out of the building and calmly told a CBC reporter outside, &#34;I will survive.&#34;[38] Just inside the Centre Block, Zehaf-Bibeau exchanged gunfire with security personnel and was wounded.[39]
Zehaf-Bibeau then ran along the Hall of Honour corridor toward the Library of Parliament. Pursued by RCMP officers, he passed, on his left, the door to a committee room in which Stephen Harper and the Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) were meeting. Directly opposite was the door to another caucus room, where leader of the opposition, Thomas Mulcair, and New Democratic Party MPs were gathered. (The Liberals, as the third party, were holding their caucus meeting in a chamber downstairs.) During the shooting, one bullet penetrated the outer doors to the NDP caucus room.[39] Inside their room, NDP MPs dove for cover. Across the hall, Harper was briefly hidden in a closet while Conservative MPs made a barricade at the doors, grabbing flagpoles to use as rudimentary spears.[40][41][42][43]
Finally, Zehaf-Bibeau reached an alcove by the entrance to the Library of Parliament, and hid out of sight of RCMP officers,[44] who ordered him to drop his gun and surrender.[38] The location of the alcove is near the office of the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers.[45] Vickers, a distinguished policeman, commander and administrator with the RCMP before he joined the staff of the House of Commons in 2005,[46] obtained a 9mm handgun from a lock-box and entered the hall.
Vickers&#39;s security team, which had been chasing Zehaf-Bibeau, yelled to Vickers that the suspect was hiding in the alcove. Vickers immediately ran behind the other side of a nearby column, then dove past the column and fired upward at Zehaf-Bibeau.[47]
Witnesses and reports show RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett, leading the tactical formation, fired the shot that killed Zehaf-Bibeau after Bibeau fired in his direction.[1][45][48][49][50] CBC television cameras on the scene recorded over 30 shots fired in the final gunfight.[38] Footage showed a group of RCMP officers converging near the alcove; two loud gunshots are heard, then a large number of gunshots in rapid succession, then silence.[38]
Vickers was recorded by CBC video footage walking away from the shooting site, going to the Conservative caucus room.[38] Vickers explained to the Conservative caucus what had happened and reportedly said either &#34;I put him down&#34;[41] or &#34;I have engaged the suspect. He is deceased.&#34;[51] According to Vickers&#39;s niece: &#34;This is the first time in his career that he&#39;s shot anyone.&#34;[52] Following the shooting, Harper&#39;s RCMP security detail arrived and evacuated him, while the Parliament buildings were put into lockdown.[53]

Michael Zehaf-Bibeau[56] (October 16, 1982 – October 22, 2014) was identified by officials as the perpetrator of the shootings.[57]
Personal background[edit]
According to court documents, he was born Joseph Paul Michael Bibeau to unmarried parents (the surname being his mother&#39;s last name), but, in 1995, his parents legally changed his name to Joseph Paul Michael Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf-Bibeau to better reflect his heritage.[56][58][59] Initial reports put out by Reuters and US-based networks[60] in the first few hours after the shooting[61] said the shooter was born &#39;Michael Joseph Hall&#39; and changed his name after converting to Islam, but these proved unreliable and were contradicted the next day by Reuters,[62] and the major Canadian news sources in in-depth reporting.[56][58][63][64]
Zehaf-Bibeau grew up in Eastern Canada, including Ottawa and Montreal.[65] His mother is Susan Bibeau, a Quebecois, from Montreal and deputy chairperson of a division of Canada&#39;s Immigration and Refugee Board.
His father is a businessman, Bulgasem Zehaf,[66][67] a Libyan immigrant to Quebec who opened the Tripoli café in Montreal. Zehaf is reported to have fought in the 2011 Libyan Civil War;[66][65] the Washington Times reported that Zehaf had returned to his hometown of Zawiyah in Libya to join the uprising against the Muammar Gaddafi regime.
The couple split up before Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s birth, but reconciled a short while after and were married.[56] Zehaf and Bibeau divorced in 1999.[66]
Zehaf-Bibeau continued to live in the Montreal area until 2007, when he spent time in Libya before moving to Western Canada to become a miner and labourer.[65]
Zehaf-Bibeau became a habitual offender with an extensive criminal record for several offences, including larceny, drug possession, and parole violations. He had received several criminal convictions, at least one of which resulted in a custodial sentence of 60 days&#39; incarceration.[67] In November 2001, just after his 19th birthday, he was convicted of possessing a false credit card and impaired driving.[68] In 2004, he pleaded guilty to drug possession for marijuana and PCP. He failed to appear at the trial date in 2006, but appeared three years later to plead guilty to marijuana possession and was given a discharge. In 2011, he was charged with robbery and &#34;uttering threats&#34; in Vancouver, but only convicted of the lesser charge of uttering threats.[69] He claimed that he committed the 2011 robbery so that he would be incarcerated, in order to kick his drug habit. He received a psychiatric evaluation, but was determined to be fit to stand for trial.[66][70]
Conversion to Islam and travels[edit]
Baptized a Roman Catholic,[71] he converted to Islam[66] in 2004[66] and had attended Sunni Muslim[72] mosques in the British Columbia cities of Burnaby and Vancouver.[65] A mosque in Vancouver, British Columbia, expelled him. &#39;His behaviour was not normal,&#39; said David Ali, vice-president of Masjid Al-Salaam mosque in nearby Burnaby. He said: &#39;We try to be open to everyone. But people on drugs don&#39;t behave normally.&#39;[73] Also, an acquaintance recalled that he had &#34;erratic&#34; behaviour, he had said &#34;the devil is after him&#34;, and was requested to stop attending the mosque after upsetting religious elders.[74] The acquaintance believed he was mentally ill.[75]
Zehaf-Bibeau wanted to leave Canada. An associate of Zehaf-Bibeau reported he had discussed wanting to go to Libya to study Arabic and Islam.[65] At their October 23 press conference, the RCMP said his mother told them that he wanted to go to Syria to join the anti-government rebels in the Syrian civil war,[65][76][77][78] but she denied this, stating that she told the RCMP that he was intending to travel to Saudi Arabia. &#34;He thought he would be happier in an Islamic country where they would share his beliefs.&#34;[79][80] In a telephone interview with the press, Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s mother said she grieves for the victims of the attack, not her son. In an email to the press, she also said &#34;I am mad at my son,&#34; and said &#34;he seemed lost and did not fit in.&#34;[81]
Zehaf-Bibeau arrived in Ottawa on or before October 2, ostensibly to pursue securing a passport. Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a Canadian passport and a background check was in progress. RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said this issue was central in driving the attacks.[13] Zehaf-Bibeau, who may also have had Libyan citizenship,[82] applied for a Libyan passport renewal on October 2 and was refused the same day.[55] Zehaf-Bibeau had received a Libyan passport in 2000 and then travelled to Libya in 2007. That document had expired, and Zehaf-Bibeau told officials that he wanted a new passport so he could visit family and friends in Libya.[55]
Before the shootings[edit]
Zehaf-Bibeau had been staying at the Ottawa Mission, a homeless shelter in Ottawa near Parliament Hill. According to other residents of the mission, Zehaf-Bibeau and two other men had been trying to get a vehicle. Others said of Zehaf-Bibeau and the other two men, &#34;You knew they were up to something shifty, pacing around a lot and everything.&#34;[83] The vehicle used by Zehaf-Bibeau was purchased one day before the shootings.[30] One resident of the mission noted that Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s mood had changed three days before the attacks, and he attributed it to Zehaf-Bibeau going back on drugs. Zehaf-Bibeau reportedly told the other residents that he was &#34;anti-Canadian&#34; and to pray because &#34;the world is ending&#34;.[84] Another resident reported that Zehaf-Bibeau had shown a lot of interest in the Parliament buildings, including asking how easy was it to get into the Parliament buildings.[85]
A day before the attack, multiple witnesses saw Zehaf-Bibeau engaged in a &#34;heated discussion&#34; with another man while waiting to register his purchase of the vehicle used in the shootings. According to a witness, Zehaf-Bibeau said &#34;If soldiers bombed your family, wouldn&#39;t you want to kill them?&#34;. Staff in the registry office asked him to lower his voice or leave. The purchase was disallowed by the office because of his out-of-province identification. The purchase was never registered and Zehaf-Bibeau pasted a piece of junk mail on the car to mimic a temporary license permit.[86]
How Zehaf-Bibeau obtained his gun has not been determined.[87] At the time of the shootings, Zehaf-Bibeau was legally prohibited from possessing or acquiring firearms.[3] Additionally, his previous criminal charges and convictions, history of drug abuse, and lack of a fixed address all would have prevented him from receiving a Canadian Firearms Licence.[3] A knife that Zehaf-Bibeau had with him on October 22 was determined to have originated from a relative&#39;s home.[87]
After the shootings[edit]
On November 15, it was reported that Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s body had remained at the Ottawa coroner&#39;s office for examination. According to the procedure to be followed by the coroner, the examination must report the entry and exit wound of each gunshot wound, and a toxicology report. The issue of accepting his body for an eventual funeral was problematic for the Ottawa Muslim Association mosque: &#34;while denouncing what he did as a crime, a terrorist attack against a soldier who was serving the country, we say that if he&#39;s believing in God, if he&#39;s a Muslim, then he should be buried,&#34; said imam Samy Metwally. &#34;We will give him a funeral service.&#34;[88] However, on November 18, the coroner in an interview announced that the body was released &#34;over a week ago&#34;. The coroner did not release the details of the autopsy, when the body was released or whom the body was released to, citing legal restrictions.[89] On February 26, 2015, the Ottawa Citizen reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was buried in Zawiya, Libya, by arrangements made by his family.[90]
Casualties[edit]

Corporal Nathan Frank Cirillo[91] (December 23, 1989 – October 22, 2014), a 24-year-old Canadian soldier, was killed.[92] He was a Class-A reservist[93] of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada from Hamilton, Ontario. He was, as a chosen member of the Ceremonial Guard, on sentry duty[94] at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the National War Memorial when he was shot. Although several civilians immediately provided assistance for the wounded reservist,[95] Cirillo died in hospital later that morning.[92][96] Cirillo had a standard issue Colt Canada C7 rifle which, in accordance with standard practice, was unloaded.[97]
Samearn Son, a House of Commons constable, was injured. When Zehaf-Bibeau arrived at the Centre Block, he was confronted by Son. Son, who was unarmed, was shot in the foot while trying to wrestle away Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s gun. Son&#39;s actions caused a critical delay, allowing other security personnel to mobilize to stop Zehaf-Bideau.[98] Son was treated and released by Ottawa Civic Hospital.[97]
Two other unidentified people who were injured in unspecified locations were treated and released at Ottawa Civic Hospital.[5][99]  Corporal Cirillo&#39;s remains are buried in the very middle of the military section of Woodland Cemetery in Burlington, Ontario.[100]
Aftermath[edit]
Ottawa[edit]
Ottawa&#39;s downtown core was put under lockdown while a search began for a potential second shooter.[101] Buildings under lockdown included the Parliament buildings, the University of Ottawa and the United States embassy.[1][49] Initially, police reported a third shooting had taken place near the Rideau Centre mall at the same time. A few hours later, police corrected this mistaken report, stating that only two shootings took place.[101]   The locations of the two shooting incidents: 1. the war memorial, 2. the Centre Block
At a press conference at 14:00, Ottawa police confirmed Cirillo&#39;s death without using his name, pending notification of his family. The RCMP confirmed Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s death, without his name or any other details, citing the ongoing investigation. The National Defence headquarters, the parliament buildings and other government facilities remained in lockdown while a search of the area took place.[102] Areas around Parliament Hill including the Rideau Centre and the University of Ottawa remained closed for hours with buildings in lockdown, with police searching buildings room by room for shooters. Police lifted the lockdown on all public schools in and around Ottawa&#39;s downtown core at around 5:45 p.m.  Parliament Hill remained under lockdown until well past 21:00 and, even after MPs and staffers were allowed to leave the Centre Block, streets directly adjacent to Parliament Hill and the National War Memorial remained closed to the public the next day.[103] Parliament Hill reopened to the public on October 24, and Parliament Buildings tours resumed on October 27.[104]
Nationally and internationally[edit]
Canadian Armed Forces members in Ottawa, Quebec and Atlantic Canada were told to stay out of uniform when not on active duty,[105][106][107] while members in other parts of Canada were not asked to avoid wearing uniforms.[108][109] Further, Canadian military bases around the country heightened their security.[107] The incident caused cancellation of a ceremony scheduled for later the same day in Toronto, in which Nobel Peace Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai was to receive her certificate of honorary Canadian citizenship from Stephen Harper.[110]
Although security was heightened at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in Toronto, all of the party leaders agreed that the day&#39;s session of Question Period should continue.[111] In Edmonton, public tours were cancelled for the day at the Legislative Assembly of Alberta and security increased.[112] The Legislative Assembly of British Columbia was placed under restricted access and most constituency offices on Vancouver Island were closed as a precaution.[113] Nova Scotia&#39;s legislature, sitting that day, restricted access in the public gallery to the press and staff of the government and political parties.[114] The National Assembly of Quebec flew its flag at half mast the evening of October 22 as a tribute to Cirillo.[115]
In the United States, security was increased in Washington, D.C.: at the Canadian embassy, United States federal government offices nearby, and the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.[116]  The Australian Federal Police increased security at Australia&#39;s Parliament House, as well as at the Canadian High Commission in Canberra.[117]  Security at the New Zealand Parliament Buildings was also tightened.[118]
Investigation and government response[edit]
Initially, the Ottawa Police Service (OPS) said they were investigating the shooting at the war memorial, while the RCMP was investigating the shooting at Centre Block.[49] However, on October 23, the OPS announced that the shooting had been declared a matter of national security and, as such, the entire investigation would be turned over to the RCMP. It was also announced that the RCMP had in turn asked the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) to conduct a standard independent investigation into the response of police and security forces.[119][120]
Recalled were reports issued by the Auditor General of Canada on the security of the House of Commons and the Senate.[121][122] While many operational aspects were praised, it was noted that possible jurisdictional confusion could result between the RCMP, Ottawa Police, the House of Commons Security Services, and the Senate Protective Service and that no agency had jurisdiction over the roofs of the parliament buildings.[123] The day after the shooting, Prime Minister Harper pledged to expedite plans to boost security forces&#39; surveillance, detention, and arrest powers;[124] other members of the government indicated consideration was being made toward ways to magnify anti-terrorism laws.
The RCMP on October 23 released security video showing Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s movements across the Parliament Hill precinct. They also announced that Zehaf-Bibeau was not one of 93 suspected extremists on a RCMP high-risk traveller list, though email written by Zehaf-Bibeau had been found on a computer belonging to an unnamed individual charged with terrorism offences.[125] At this meeting, RCMP Commissioner Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s mother had told the RCMP that he wanted to go to Syria, but she denied this, stating that, in a recorded interview, she had told the RCMP that he had wanted to go to Saudi Arabia.[79]
It was announced by the RCMP on October 26 that they had &#34;persuasive evidence&#34; showing Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s attack had been &#34;driven by ideological and political motives.&#34;[87] According to the RCMP, Zehaf-Bibeau had recorded a video of himself prior to the attack in which, Commissioner Paulson alleged that &#34;[Zehaf-Bibeau] was quite deliberate, he was quite lucid and he was quite purposeful in articulating the basis for his actions. They were in respect, broadly, to Canada&#39;s foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs.&#34; The RCMP did not release the video, which they said they were studying for &#34;its intelligence and evidence value&#34;, but Paulson said they hoped to release it eventually.[14]
Paulson appeared before a parliamentary committee on October 27 to brief MPs. &#34;While we are facing this threat at home, we must focus our efforts on preventing individuals traveling abroad to commit acts of terrorism. Preventing the individuals from traveling is critical. If these individuals return with training and/or battle experience, they pose an even greater threat to Canada and our allies.&#34;[126]
That day, the government, after delay caused by the shootings, introduced a bill to broaden the powers of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Among other powers, it would allow the agency to operate internationally and introduce a program to revoke Canadian citizenship of dual nationals who are convicted of terrorism.[126] The Canadian Civil Liberties Association urged the government to not over-react: &#34;before we take steps to expand existing police and intelligence power, we need answers about why the power that we have were not used, or were insufficient, to prevent or avoid recent tragedies.&#34;[127] On October 29, Minister of Justice Peter MacKay said the government would work to prevent the promotion of terrorism online.[128]
The media reported on November 13 that security video taken at the Centre Block parliament building showed that Zehaf-Bibeau had taken a tour of the  building three weeks before the attack. The security video was not released to the public.[129] A large knife was found next to Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s body after he was killed, and it was reported that the RCMP&#39;s working theory of his actions was that he intended to behead someone.[85]
On November 23, the government announced that they would unify the various security forces of the House of Commons and the Senate under one command.[130] The existence of the two separate forces had been identified as a point of failure in the October 22 incident. Other areas suggested to be addressed was the need for better surveillance equipment including a central surveillance officer, and a lack of networking between the forces, including the RCMP.[131]
On December 1, RCMP Commissioner Paulson said the RCMP would not release the video of Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s alleged motives. Members of Parliament had called for its release, stating that he should not comment on it without releasing it for public discussion. Paulson said releasing a partial transcript was possible.[132] The same day, CBC News reported that Centre Block security video showed that Zehaf-Bibeau had been shot once in an exchange of gunfire with Commons security before running along the Hall of Honour towards the Library of Parliament.[39] On December 3, the Toronto Star, National Post and Winnipeg Free Press major newspapers called for the videos to be released.[133][134]
On December 17, Prime Minister Harper suggested that the attacker may not have been acting alone, but did not elaborate.[135] In an interview on national television, Harper would not confirm he was hidden in a closet during the shootings, but said his first concern was to extricate himself from the location. &#34;All you hear is a whole lot of shooting coming towards you, and you don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a firefight or whether it&#39;s just a bunch of guys with automatic weapons wiping everybody out in their path.&#34; After the incident, Harper&#39;s first call was to his mother to reassure her.[136]
The Ontario Provincial Police started two further investigations into the incident. After October 22, the OPP started a review of the RCMP actions on Parliament Hill. On October 29, the House of Commons Speaker asked the OPP to review the conduct of House of Commons constables. On November 24, the RCMP asked the OPP to review Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s actions from the Memorial to Parliament Hill. The RCMP will then act on revising its security after the reviews are complete. Until that time, the RCMP has increased its numbers around Parliament by rotating new officers for two-month terms to Parliament Hill security.[137] The OPP report was released on the internet with redactions.[138]
On February 24, 2015, the Canadian House of Commons public safety committee passed a motion to invite RCMP Commissioner Paulson to &#34;publicly display and discuss the video&#34; that Zehaf-Bibeau recorded at a future meeting of the committee.[139] Commissioner Paulson showed the video (minus 18 seconds which the RCMP said might be pertinent to investigations into accomplices) at the public safety committee meeting of March 6. Zehaf-Bibeau is quoted as saying: &#34;This is in retaliation for Afghanistan and because Harper [Prime Minister Stephen Harper] wants to send his troops to Iraq. Canada&#39;s officially become one of our enemies by fighting and bombing us and creating a lot of terror in our countries and killing us and killing our innocents. So, just aiming to hit some soldiers just to show that you&#39;re not even safe in your own land, and you gotta be careful. We&#39;ll not cease until you guys decide to be a peaceful country and stay to your own and stop going to other countries and stop occupying and killing the righteous of us who are trying to bring back religious law in our countries. Thank you.&#34; The video was recorded in the car, in Ottawa, on the day of the shootings and was found in the car abandoned in front of Parliament. Paulson said he believes that someone else was involved, and if they were found to have aided Zehaf-Bibeau, that they would be charged with terrorism offences. Paulson also said a post-mortem test for drugs and alcohol on Zehaf-Bibeau was negative and that he had a long knife tied to his wrist when he was killed by Parliament Hill security.[140]
Paulson further briefed Parliament that the RCMP has over 130 full-time investigators and staff on the case. Paulson reiterated the RCMP&#39;s position that Zehaf-Bibeau was a terrorist under Section 83.01 of the Criminal Code, and that he would have been charged with terrorism offences had he survived. OPP investigators also possess the security video taken inside the Parliament building when Zehaf-Bibeau was killed. The RCMP did not determine the source of the gun Zehaf-Bibeau used. They found witnesses to him loading it into his car.[141]
On May 29, 2015, the RCMP released the full transcript of Zehaf-Bibeau&#39;s video. The missing 18 seconds included Zehaf-Bibeau asking God to praise his actions and curse those he is targeting.[142]
In June 2015, the CBC reported some information from the OPP report. The CBC reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was hit 31 times by police including a shot to the back of the head by RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett after which the RCMP stopped firing. He was then hand-cuffed although he was already dead. Vickers himself shot 15 times. After entering the Centre Block, there was an exchange of gunfire between Zehaf-Bibeau and House of Commons Security Corporal Malo. Zehaf-Bibeau then ran down the Hall of Honour. House of Commons Security Constable Louis Letourneau shot at Zehaf-Bibeau 15 times, hitting him once, an event recorded on Centre Block security video. Four RCMP officers advanced on Zehaf-Bibeau, who took one more shot, narrowly missing RCMP Constable Barrett, then started a barrage at Zehaf-Bibeau. The OPP report concluded that the officers&#39; actions were all justified.[143] The OPP report also contained the information that it was determined that Zehaf-Bibeau shot Corporal Cirillo three times in the back at the War Memorial, not twice as was previously reported.[143]
In October 2015, CTV News reported that it had obtained an &#34;unredacted&#34; copy of the OPP report. In it, it was reported that four RCMP officers were involved in the shootout: Const. Curtis Barrett, Const. Martin Fraser, Sgt. Rick Rozon and Corp. Dany Daigle. According to CTV News, the constables were told after Kevin Vickers was applauded for his actions that &#34;the Kevin Vickers train has left the station but you guys will get internal recognition.&#34; Recognition was to include a commissioner&#39;s commendation and recommendation for a Governor General&#39;s Award. According to CTV, the officers did not receive commendations and were on stress leave.[144] Barrett would eventually be recognized after his involvement in the shooting was confirmed and previously lost.[145]
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police established &#34;Project Savvy&#34; to pro-actively look for threats to Canadian security in open source media, including social networks.[146]
Reactions[edit]
On October 23, MPs in the House of Commons gave a standing ovation to Vickers for his heroism. As Mulcair of the New Democratic Party put it: &#34;Just as we have all borne witness to these horrific acts, we have watched in awe your acts of courage, now an abiding emblem of Canadian strength, values and valour.&#34;[147] The first order of business was a moment of silence for Cirillo.[148] Prior to the day&#39;s session, Harper laid a wreath at the War Memorial; MPs from all parties attended a moment of silence and sang &#34;O Canada&#34; at the Memorial before walking together to Parliament.[149] The flags at Parliament Hill and other federal government buildings were also flown at half-mast.[149]
A National Hockey League (NHL) game to have taken place on October 22 in Ottawa, between the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs, was postponed and rescheduled for November 9.[150] Over the following days, several NHL teams held moments of silence and &#34;O Canada&#34; was sung prior to games in the United States in which no Canadian team was participating.[151][152]  On October 25, pre-game ceremonies were jointly held in Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto to honour the deceased and first responders.[153] On the same day of the attack, before a NHL game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers, the Canadian National Anthem was sung in honour of the attack.[154] The largest Canadian flag was used for a pre-game ceremony between the Ottawa Redblacks and the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL.[155]
A fund to benefit the families of Cirillo and Vincent was started on October 22 with a goal of CDN$10,000. It surpassed its goal by noon the following day, when representatives of Canadian banks called to arrange a donation of $80,000. By October 29, the fund, known as the Stand On Guard Fund, had raised $550,000.[156] The fund raised $705,000 of a newly-set $750,000 goal by the time the fund-raising deadline was reached.[157]
A mosque in Cold Lake, Alberta, was defaced overnight with graffiti. This was immediately cleaned up in a joint effort with local residents.[158] An Ottawa mosque was the scene of two incidents: A member praised Zehaf-Bibeau as a martyr after prayers, leading to the police stopping him for national security reasons the next day. A vandal then destroyed several windows, causing over $10,000 in damages.[159]
As soon as the war memorial was reopened to the public, a makeshift memorial to Cirillo grew in front of it; residents laid out flowers, cards, and wreaths. On October 24, 2014, Cirillo&#39;s body was transported home to Hamilton in an official motorcade along Ontario Highway 401, the portion of which between Trenton and Toronto is known as the Highway of Heroes. The times of the motorcade were publicized and people stood at overpasses to observe and as it passed. Cirillo&#39;s family released a statement and gave thanks to the Canadian Forces for the support offered and to those who came to the soldier&#39;s aid.[160] Thousands attended visitation at the funeral home where Cirillo lay in repose. He was accorded the honour of a full regimental funeral service and funeral procession on October 28 in Hamilton, attended by family, soldiers, and dignitaries.[161]
On October 27, a concert by the National Arts Centre Orchestra (NAC Orchestra) (from Ottawa) and Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (from London) concert was dedicated to Patrice Vincent and Nathan Cirillo and was attended by Prince Charles. The NAC Orchestra dedicated its entire UK tour of five performances to Vincent and Cirillo.[162]
On November 11, the annual Remembrance Day service at the war memorial was held as planned. It was attended by Anne, Princess Royal, along with the Governor General, the Prime Minister, and other dignitaries. It was attended by a larger than normal crowd of 50,000. This was attributed to &#34;a rising tide of concern for Canada&#39;s Forces&#34; since the attacks.[163] There was an increased police presence at the event because of the two killings[164] and military armored vehicles patrolled the area, while military personnel were deployed on nearby rooftops.[163] Persons have continued to leave &#34;bouquets, poppies, photos, poems, written tributes, stuffed animals, a can or two of beer, even a battered hockey stick&#34; at the war memorial, although the government has removed the items several times.[163]
Statements on the shootings[edit]
Canadian[edit]
Immediate reactions came from MPs John McKay: &#34;There was a pop, pop, pop sound so the guards ushered us to the back of the building&#34; and David McGuinty: describing there is a &#34;palpable sense of fear&#34; in Ottawa and &#34;it&#39;s extremely unusual for such an atmosphere to exist in the city&#34;. Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said it was a &#34;sad and tragic day for the city and country.&#34;[165] Other Canadian politicians and social media also reacted.[166]
Elizabeth II, the Queen of Canada, issued a statement from her and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, expressing shock and sadness.[167] Her federal representative, Governor General David Johnston, extended his sympathies to the family of the deceased Canadian soldier and gratitude for the &#34;professionalism and courage of our security personnel and emergency responders.&#34;[168]
In a televised address that evening, Harper called the shootings a &#34;brutal and violent attack&#34;[169] and made specific reference to the ISIL-inspired attack on Canadian soldiers two days earlier.[170] Harper insisted that &#34;Canada will not be intimidated&#34; by acts of violence and remained committed to Canada&#39;s efforts &#34;to work with our allies around the world and fight against the terrorist organizations who brutalize those in other countries with the hope of bringing their savagery to our shores. They will have no safe haven.&#34;[170] Harper classified both of the week&#39;s attacks as terrorism in his address to the House of Commons on October 23, saying &#34;we&#39;re all aware and deeply troubled that both of this week&#39;s terrorist attacks were carried out by Canadian citizens, by young men born and raised in this peaceful country.&#34;[171]
Tom Mulcair, the Leader of the Official Opposition, called the shooting a &#34;cowardly act designed to strike at the heart of our democracy&#34; that was &#34;designed to drive [Canadians] to hate.&#34;[147] Mulcair categorized Zehaf-Bibeau as a criminal, not a terrorist: &#34;I don&#39;t think we have enough evidence to use that word.&#34;[172]
Justin Trudeau, the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, said &#34;Canadians know acts such as these committed in the name of Islam are an aberration of [the Muslim] faith. Mutual respect and admiration will help to prevent the influence of distorted ideological propaganda posing as religion.&#34;[147] He agreed with the RCMP that this was a terrorist attack.[172]
Green Party leader Elizabeth May said in the House of Commons: &#34;I would put money on these being the acts of isolated, disturbed and deeply troubled men who were drawn to something crazy. I do not believe that it was a vast network, or that the country is more at risk today than it was last week. However, that is my opinion. I can be wrong...I am undoubtedly going to be wrong again, but what I would like to suggest is that we wait for answers from the police before we make assumptions, and that we speak calmly, truthfully and openly to all Canadians.&#34;[124]
Premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne said, &#34;Our belief is that people who are using violence to undermine democracy want us to be silenced and we refuse to be silenced.&#34;[173][174]
A public statement by the Muslim Association of Canada condemned the violence in Ottawa and Quebec: &#34;MAC would like to offer its condolences to the victims of violence over the past week. We are horrified by these acts of violence, especially in the Parliament of our nation&#39;s capital. We stand with all Canadians in condemning these attacks and seeking justice for those responsible.&#34;[175] The National Council of Canadian Muslims also said it: &#34;stands united with Canadians in categorically condemning today&#39;s shooting attacks.&#34;[176]
Considerable media attention was paid to the ideology and pathology of Zehaf-Bibeau. Along with Martin Couture-Rouleau and Justin Bourque, he has been labelled a &#34;lone-wolf terrorist&#34;.[177] Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were &#34;both self-radicalized and adrift in their lives and connected in their sympathy to radical Islamic ideology.&#34;[178] Other opinions diverged from simply calling Zehaf-Bibeau a terrorist. Andrea Polko, girlfriend of Nathan Cirillo said in a statement on Facebook that the dysfunctional state of the Canadian mental health care system was to blame for the shooting.[179] Vancouver Sun columnist Ian Mulgrew commented on how the incident, as well as a failed bombing attempt in Victoria by persons motivated similarly to Zehaf-Bibeau, showed &#39;gaping holes&#39; in the social security net. &#34;These incidents are examples not of Muslim extremism but of the lack of community support for the dysfunctional of any faith who, with a lack of proper attention or the wrong catalyst, become dangerous. I know which approach would make me feel safer, what I would call real security measures: a social safety net that caught those in obvious need before they went postal, people like Zehaf-Bibeau.&#34;[180] Further divergence of opinion appeared in the criticism of the government&#39;s labelling the shooting as a terrorist attack. James Baxter, editor-in-chief of ipolitics.ca, an Ottawa political &#39;zine, said &#34;the government is exploiting two isolated murders to push through sweeping new surveillance powers&#34; and pointed out &#34;the would-be &#39;terrorists&#39; involved were armed only with a car and a vintage hunting rifle&#34;.[181] Journalist Linda McQuaig said &#34;lots of hype about Canada and our institutions being under attack — even as it got harder to explain the difference between the &#39;terrorist&#39; murders of two soldiers and the &#39;non-terrorist&#39; murders of three RCMP officers in Moncton. The main difference appeared to be that the shooter in Moncton was not a follower of Islam&#34;.[182] Academic Emer O&#39;Toole said there was a double standard in the response by the Harper government relative to the 2014 Moncton shooting saying, &#34;Harper&#39;s minimal statement after Justin Bourque shot and killed three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in Moncton, New Brunswick, in June, made no mention of terror. Yet Bourque&#39;s actions bore the hallmarks of a conservative and conspiratorial anti-state worldview reminiscent of Norwegian killer Anders Breivik. There was no appeal to Canadian solidarity in the face of an attack on &#34;our country, our values, on our society&#34;; there was no affirmation to &#34;remain vigilant against those at home and abroad who would harm us.&#34;[183]
A national poll by the Angus Reid organization released on November 25, 2014 revealed that Canadians in general were also split as well on whether the attack and shooting was an act of terrorism or mental illness. 38% felt that it was the result of mental illness, while 36% felt it was terrorism, with 25% undecided. Asked about what the federal government should do as a result, 54% felt that more initiatives should be done to prevent radicalization, while 34% favoured harsher punishments. On how to deal with homegrown terrorists, 54% felt that indefinite incarceration only motivated persons to commit crimes, while 46% felt it prevented violent crime.[184]
American[edit]
President Barack Obama was briefed about the attacks. The White House released a statement that read: &#34;President Obama condemned these outrageous attacks, and reaffirmed the close friendship and alliance between our people.&#34;[117] In the following week, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry made a visit to Ottawa, which included laying a wreath at the National War Memorial in honour of the soldier killed.
Journalist Glenn Greenwald said that the Canadian government was exploiting the shootings by wasting &#34;no time in seizing on the incident to promote its fear-mongering agenda over terrorism, which includes pending legislation to vest its intelligence agency, CSIS, with more spying and secrecy powers in the name of fighting ISIS.&#34; He also said that the shootings weren&#39;t an act of terrorism, writing that, &#34;... to the extent the term [terrorism] has any common understanding, it includes the deliberate (or wholly reckless) targeting of civilians with violence for political ends. But in this case in Canada, it wasn&#39;t civilians who were targeted. If one believes the government&#39;s accounts of the incident, the driver waited two hours until he saw a soldier in uniform. In other words, he seems to have deliberately avoided attacking civilians, and targeted a soldier instead – a member of a military that is currently fighting a war.&#34;[185] Greenwald&#39;s opinion was in turn criticized by academic Daniel W. Drezner who said that his argument was both banal and incomplete, and that the reason why there was shock in Canada at the attack was that democracies at least claimed to adhere to jus in bello when they prosecuted violent conflicts, whereas some of their opponents did not.[186]
An article in The Daily Beast suggested that the attacks by Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were connected with the 2014 New York City hatchet attack. Like them, the New York attacker was labelled as a &#34;lone wolf,&#34; although Siegel writes that those who are moved from anger to spontaneous deadly action most often fit the profiles of borderline psychotics more than hardcore believers.[187] He cites a 2010 study by terrorism analyst Brian Jenkins of the RAND Corporation, which states that it would be more appropriate to describe &#34;lone wolves&#34; as &#34;stray dogs&#34; which, &#34;&#34;while still dangerous, skulk about, sniffing at violence, vocally aggressive but skittish without backup.&#34;[187]
British[edit]
Prime Minister David Cameron said he was &#34;appalled by [the] attack in Ottawa&#34; and offered his full support to his Canadian and Commonwealth counterpart, Stephen Harper, and the Canadian people as they dealt with the incident.[188]
An editorial in The Guardian on October 26 said &#34;it is hard to judge the exact significance of this week&#39;s events&#34; and &#34;[Canada&#39;s] diversity is reflected in an acute sensitivity to the risks of conflating the threat of terror with Islam itself, which represents the country&#39;s second largest faith community.&#34;  The editorial ended with:
And only a fortnight ago, its parliament voted to join the coalition in support of the US bombing of Isis targets: the country&#39;s security agencies were clear that they believed the decision would heighten the risk of a terrorist attack.  Lawmakers were drafting legislation to combat radical violence before this latest attack. Politicians should now pause before succumbing to the temptation to rush through laws that further restrict civil liberties in the name of national security. It would be a betrayal of all that Canada represents if it allowed exceptional, and horrific, events to remould that society.[189]
An editorial in The Economist from November 8, 2014, in discussing the impact on US-Canada border security, said:
The attack in Ottawa last month by a lone gunman, who killed a Canadian soldier and stormed parliament, seems likely to make matters worse. Although there is still uncertainty about the motives of the gunman, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau—possibly a deranged outcast, possibly a religious extremist—the United States is reviewing security along the 5,525-mile (8,890km) line which separates the two countries (including the Alaskan land border).[190]
Supranational[edit]
United Nations: The United Nations issued a statement that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was &#34;aware of the situation...[and] he hopes the situation will be brought quickly under control by Canadian law enforcement authorities. His thoughts are with the people and government of Canada at this difficult time.&#34;[188]
NATO: Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg issued a press release expressing his shock and sadness at the shootings and condolences for the family of the victim.[191]
NORAD: Commander General Charles H. Jacoby issued a statement that offered condolences: &#34;My heart goes out to our Canadian comrades on this tragic day following the shootings in Ottawa, as well as the hit-and-run attack in Quebec earlier this week, both of which targeted Canadian Armed Forces personnel. We offer our sincerest condolences to the people of Canada.  We share their grief, but also their determination not to be intimidated by these cowardly acts.&#34;[116]
Other sovereign states[edit]
Australia: Both Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, and Mark Binskin, the Chief of the Defence Force, issued statements of condolence and solidarity with Canada.[192]
France: President François Hollande, who made a state visit to Canada, said: &#34;I want to express all of France&#39;s solidarity with the families of the victims tragically murdered in those terrorist attacks that caused such grief to your country.&#34;[193]
Georgia: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement expressing &#34;its deep concern over the attack&#34; and stating &#34;its solidarity with the Canadian Government and the Canadian people.&#34;[194]
India: Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack, saying, &#34;As a nation that has experienced a horrific terrorist attack on its Parliament, we share the sense of outrage and trauma of the people of Canada over the attack on the highest institution of democracy. Canada is one of India&#39;s strongest partners and we will continue to strengthen our cooperation in combating terrorism and other crimes for a safer future for our people.&#34;[195]
Israel: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered condolences and support.[196]
Malaysia: Ronald Kiandee, the Deputy Speaker of the lower house of the Malaysian parliament, condemned the attack, saying such incidents to Canada&#39;s parliament &#34;should never have happened&#34;.[197]
New Zealand: Prime Minister John Key offered condolences and solidarity.[196]
Singapore: A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson condemned the attack and said: &#34;The attacks underscore the need for countries to remain vigilant in dealing with the threat posed by terrorists.&#34;[198]

Justin Bourque’s 2014 Cop-Killing Rampage in Moncton, New Brunswick
Published June 3, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.
On June 4th, 2014, shortly after 7 p.m., Justin Bourque left his trailer dressed in camouflage, a bandana on his head, and two firearms strapped to his back. He walked toward an upscale subdivision a few blocks away.
Bourque ignored the civilians he encountered.
“Don’t worry, I’m not out to kill civilians. I’m after government officials,” Bourque told one resident.
His desired target?
Uniformed RCMP members.
Within 20 minutes of the first RCMP member’s arrival, Bourque murdered RCMP Constable Fabrice Gevaudan, RCMP Constable Dave Ross and RCMP Constable Douglas Larche.
He also wounded RCMP Constable Darlene Goguen and RCMP Constable Éric Dubois.
During those 20 minutes, Bourque went to great lengths to avoid shooting civilians. He even ignored plainclothes Constable Douglas Larche until Larche shot at him.
Over 970 RCMP personnel from across New Brunswick and Canada were involved in the massive manhunt and investigation. Transport Canada provided an aircraft with infrared detection ability that, in the end, determined Bourque’s exact location for the RCMP.
Justin Bourque’s 2014 killing spree in Moncton, New Brunswick, left three wives without their husbands, six children without their fathers and a community without three courageous RCMP constables willing to put themselves in harm’s way to protect others.
It left countless other family, friends, and community members traumatized and terrified.
Those are the basic facts but there is more to this story than one deranged person who hates cops.
Much more.
Article Road Map
This is a lengthy article about complex case. To make it easier to navigate, I’ve broken it down into the following headings:
Motive: Why Kill Cops?
Bourque’s Descent Into Madness and Why Gun Owners are Hated
Bourque’s Guilty Plea and Sentencing
Independent Investigation and Report
RCMP Guilty of Labour Code Violations for Inadequate Training

Motive: Why Kill Cops?
One theory is Bourque was angry at the RCMP for allegedly killing 30-year-old Daniel Levesque in 2013. This idea was presented online by friends of Bourque’s on Facebook, where Bourque wasn’t shy about his hatred for police.
An independent investigation by the Fredericton Police Force concluded stab wounds Levesque suffered before his final interaction with police were the cause of death, not the four bullet wounds he received from police.
(I’ve requested a copy of the report into the death of Daniel Levesque from the Fredericton Police. If the report says anything other than what I expect it to say (all four bullet wounds were non-fatal), I’ll update this section accordingly.)
Another theory presented by Bourque himself is he targeted uniformed RCMP members as part of his rebellion against Canada’s oppressive government.
When asked what he was thinking after he escaped into the woods, Bourque said he was proud of the fact he killed police officers.
“Well, honestly, I know this is going to sound really messed up, but I actually felt pretty accomplished. I know you probably thing that’s really sick but, um, you know, it’s just… when you see what’s happening through the centuries and we just compare what happened here, you know, it’s just … It’s sad they might have had a wife and kids, but every soldier has a wife and kids, right, and it’s all about who’s side you chose and they chose the wrong one.”
Defence counsel David M. Lutz described Justin Bourque this way in the Defendant’s Sentencing Brief:
As the psychological and psychiatric assessment and the pre-sentencing report indicate he is immature, socially inept and easily influenced by unfounded external factors. He is the “perfect storm,” in terms of social adaptability:
homeschooled and thereby unable to interact appropriately with his peers;
addicted to violent video games on the level of a pre-teen or young teenager;
marijuana dependant; and
a paranoid gun aficionado.
The evidence is that his dedication to the “right wing” gun culture and resulting beliefs caused him to raise his love of guns and their use to alienate him from his family, to say nothing about the rest of society.
(…)
To attribute “…hatred for authority and police;” to him characterizes the defendant’s motive to a higher thought process then he possessed on June 4th, 2014. It would be easy to write him off as a zealot but he is, as stated above, a social inept frustrated young man. He tragically progressed from violent video games to acting them out in real life. His belief that the RCMP officers were “soldiers” in the employ and propping-up of a corrupt government has no factual foundation and was the result defective thinking influenced by online routine.
Crown counsel Cameron Gunn saw Bourque’s motive quite differently.
“He targeted them not because of any animosity to them specifically, but for lust or greed or any of the normal things you might see in a murder sentencing. He targeted them specifically because of who they were, what they did, the badge they carried, the flash on their shoulders, and the uniform they wore.”
— Canadian Press, October 28, 2014

Bourque’s Descent Into Madness and Why Gun Owners are Hated
Justin Bourque’s descent into murderous madness is one reason why so many non-gun owning Canadians licenced gun owners.
From MacLean’s Magazine:
Only Justin Bourque knows for sure (and even he may not). But his downward spiral appears to have begun more than two years ago, as he grew increasingly fixated on faraway wars and the right to bear arms.
He talked to buddies about the looming apocalypse, and his desire to “live off the grid.” Some friends feared that Bourque, a regular pot smoker, had turned to much harder substances, fuelling his paranoia.
“Ask yourself, would you fight for the future of your children or grandchildren, or your family and friends sons and daughters?” he wrote on his Facebook page April 7, two months before the rampage. “The answer is: no you’re too stupid to know what to fight for, cause we’re already losing the silent war you don’t wanna believe is happening.”
Looming apocalypses and the right to bear arms are two of the alarm bells anti-gun advocates ring as loud as they can in their efforts to denigrate all firearm owners.
Why?
Because these two themes instill a visceral fear of gun owners in those who don’t know much about guns or Canada’s existing firearms control legislation.
Justin Bourque checked all the right boxes as far as these groups are concerned.
He had no criminal record
He applied for and was issued a firearms licence (which expired prior to his shooting spree)
He legally purchased the guns and ammunition he used to murder three RCMP officers and injure two others.
Justin Bourque is the Poster-Boy for these anti-gun slogans:
“Every legal gun owner is law-abiding… until they are not.”
“Every gun is legal… until it is not.”
“Because every gun owner is a potential criminal.”
In short, the Justin Bourques of the world, though exceedingly rare, are the reason so many gun control advocates insist all gun owners are nothing more than murderers-in-waiting.
What so many gun owners don’t see and can’t understand is this – when we talk about our right to own guns we reinforce the negative stereotypes these non-gun owners already have of us.
This doesn’t mean we must capitulate to every demand made by the uninformed and uneducated majority.
It does mean we must stop looking at these events through our own eyes and start looking at them through the eyes of those who we, by our mere existence, terrify.
We must start speaking in language those people can hear and understand.
I say this, not to make you, my fellow gun owner, angry, but to highlight the magnitude of the education process we have in front of us.
We want the same thing every non-gun owner wants:
a safe community to raise our children
knowledge we are safe in our homes when we go to bed at night
police to disarm the people with evil intent
And, most importantly, we gun owners want – more than anything else in the world – for there to NEVER be another shooting like this again.
More than anything, that’s what Canadians who don’t own guns want too.
We have so much common ground. Our trouble is communication, understanding and methodology.
In a battle between our “right” to own a gun vs. their “right” not to pick up another dead body, it doesn’t take a rocket surgeon to figure out who wins. Or who loses.
This is why we must change how we approach the topic of gun ownership and keeping everyone safe.

Bourque’s Guilty Plea and Sentencing
On August 8, 2014, Justin Bourque pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.
Chief Justice David Smith sentenced him to three consecutive life sentences with out possibility of parole for 75 years for three first-degree murders, and an additional two life sentences to be served concurrently for the two attempted murder charges.
Justin Bourque will almost certainly die in prison.

Independent Investigation Report
Darryl Davies, a criminologist from Carleton University, was hired by the RCMP four years after four Mounties were killed by a gunman in Mayerthorpe, Alta.
His conclusions in the Mayerthorpe report, including the need for high-powered rifles and training for all RCMP members immediately, were ignored by the RCMP.
On June 30, 2014, RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson appointed Assistant Commissioner Alphonse MacNeil (ret’d) to undertake an independent review of the circumstances surrounding the Moncton shootings.
Commissioner Paulson gave MacNeil 90 days to submit his report and identified 13 areas for which Paulson wanted a review and applicable recommendations.
On June 4, 2014, Assistant Commissioner Alphonse MacNeil (ret’d) submitted his Independent Review of the Moncton Shooting to RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson.
Key recommendations include:
additional training on lethal force over-watch be provided to members
a standard list of equipment be developed for ERT duties and that this equipment be acquired and distributed across the program
Policy should be amended to state that where a general duty member is qualified in the use of a long barreled weapon and where one is available; the member must ensure the weapon is in the police vehicle while on duty
Firearms must be stored with sufficient ammunition
During high stress/high risk incidents a supervisor must clearly provide direction regarding equipment use
training material be made available concerning the difference between cover and concealment, including examples of the penetrative capabilities of bullets from various firearms
RCMP should develop an improved system to enable members to obtain ammunition for practice
relevant policies and practices should be reviewed to ensure there are appropriate controls and no constraints that would interfere with members improving their firearms proficiency
The final two recommendations are arguably the most important.
13.1 It is recommended the RCMP take immediate action to expedite deployment of patrol carbines across the Force. This action must include significant and permanent augmentation of the Force’s training capacity.
13.2 It is recommended the RCMP conduct a thorough analysis of the approval and procurement processes (including the research and development phase) relating to equipment that impacts officer safety. This analysis should include identifying an appropriate senior authority to take responsibility for such projects, establishing appropriately resourced project teams and setting deadlines for delivery.

RCMP Guilty of Labour Code Violations for Inadequate Training
On September 29, 2017, Justice Leslie Jackson found the RCMP guilty of violating Canada’s Labour Code by failing to provide adequate training and gear necessary for members to deal with a wholly foreseeable scenario such as the Moncton Shootings.
In 2018, Justice Jackson fined the RCMP a total of $550,000, divided into the following amounts:
For its labour code violations, the RCMP must pay a $100,000 fine
The RCMP must make a $300,000 contribution to l’Université de Moncton for the creation of a memorial scholarship in the names of the deceased policemen
The RCMP must pay $60,000 to an educational trust that will be divided equally between fallen officers’ six children
$75,000 will go to the Association for Workplace Tragedy Family Support
$15,000 will be paid to Valour Place Society, which offers military family support

Below are some highlights of Justice Jackson’s decision in R. v The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2017 NBPC 6.
[107] In my view the RCMP have failed to establish due diligence. Front-line officers were left exposed to potential grievous bodily harm and/or death while responding to active shooter events for years while the carbine rollout limped along, apparently on the assumption that as the likelihood of such an event was relatively rare, a timely implementation was not required.
[108] The RCMP position is that their officers who responded on June 4, 2014 had appropriate use of force equipment and training. I will deal with the training aspect later in these reasons; however it is clear to me that the use of force equipment available to those members on June 4, 2014 left them ill-prepared to engage an assailant armed with an automatic rifle.
Cst. White, who while in the Canadian Armed Forces, had been qualified in carbine use, encountered the shooter on Bromfield Avenue and testified that if a carbine were available to him he could have effectively engaged him but he knew that the shooter was out of range of his pistol. Lastly Cst. Dubois, who was actually shot while rescuing Cst. Benoit and who had a visual on the shooter but at a distance beyond the range of his pistol, testified that, based on a lifetime of experience with firearms as a hunter and his RCMP training, he could have engaged the shooter if he had a carbine. I accept as accurate their observations as to the adequacy of the firearms at their disposal in responding to this active shooter event, and reject the proposition that they were adequately armed to respond to an assailant armed with a long gun.
[109] Almost all members of RCMP management who testified at trial said that safety of their members was a priority of theirs. While they paid lip service to that ideal their actions, or in this case inactions, belie that concern.
[110] I therefore have concluded that the Defendant has not established that it acted with due diligence and find the Defendant guilty of Count One.
[114]  Defence Counsel suggests that there is no evidence that anyone in the RCMP anticipated outdoor active shooter events; however such an event occurred at Spiritwood in 2006. I reject the notion that it was not reasonably foreseeable that RCMP members could face an active shooter in an outdoor environment. In fact it was actually foreseeable.
In other words, the RCMP didn’t learn anything from the Meyerthorpe tragedy that claimed the lives of four RCMP constables, just as Darryl Davies said.

Well once again every automobile owner is legal until they are not. Drink and drive you now become a criminal! Not the tool but the person. Pens do not make spelling mistakes, the writer does. I understand this is a greater issue than a pen but removing the pen will not resolve the ideology of the writer. When I was in the military while on tour we approached every situation as potentially life threatening no matter what the Intel said. Stop using the opportunity to capitalize off tragic emotional situations for political gain. I would hope that elected officials are smart enough to realize what the real issues are and act on that. We are in a world of hurt if that is not fact and they believe that removing the tool will solve the issue.
My sincere regards to the officers families as I have a few friends serving and understand the politics driving the force, truly tragic. Be safe.

I like the fact that people think elected officials do the right thing for their country. I see them as having a job and wanting very much to keep that well paying job. so they do what every human being will do. protect the position they are in and get  paid as long as possible.
I am well aware that politicians suppose to serve the country and its people, but that is wishful thinking.

I agree with you that we have a monumental task to educate all the people whose firearm knowledge is gained from violent video games, violent movies and tv programs and who see every firearm as a machine gun.
More than that we must as a people move from the willingness for some members of society to use firearms as a means to settle perceived grievance and disputes.
Until we collectively view human life as sacred and every  human as our brother or sister this will not change. Certainly Trudeau’s last gun grab will not make any difference. A firearm, like a myriad of other inanimate objects, is a tool that can be used for good or evil. It all depends on the user.

Well said Chris.  Arne makes a good comment.  But his last sentence leaves a hole.  There are probably over 20 million firearms held by honest people in Canada.  There are over 2 million who have trustingly licensed themselves under the Liberal’s gun laws.  The liberals swore that their laws would not be used for confiscation.  They lied.  Now back to Arne’s last sentence.  Guns are used for both good and evil just as almost any object or machine can be used thus.  However, as much as all sports are dangerous, NO OTHER SPORT is as safe as the shooting sports.  Lawful owners of firearms are so safe in fact, that liability insurance is available in the amount of $5 million for the pittance amount of $10 PER YEAR, since actuarially, accidents or misuse is so rare as to be invisible.  NO OTHER SPORT can make that safety claim.  Law abiding responsible firearms owners are the safest and most productive members of society, being comprised of all levels, from judges, lawyers, business owners, workers, farmers, hunters, women from all walks of life, even politicians, and people of all races and means.  Yet the laws protect criminals and attack the honest.  Ever wonder why??  Until people in general realize the correct answer, our society is in grave danger.

On December 29, 2014, 53-year-old Phu Lam[1] went on a killing spree in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He shot to death eight people, including two children, most of whom were his relatives. He then committed suicide at a Vietnamese/Chinese restaurant, VN Express, in which he had a professional interest that allowed after hours access; the restaurant was located in Fort Saskatchewan, just Northeast of Edmonton. [2]
Details[edit]
Lam killed seven relatives, including two children under the age of ten, in a house in north Edmonton. Lam then went into another house in the Haddow neighbourhood of Edmonton and killed Cyndi Duong. He then drove to Fort Saskatchewan where he entered a Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant, where he had after hours access in order to complete kitchen repairs, and committed suicide by shooting himself.[3] Police entered the restaurant at 7:34 a.m. on December 30, where they found Lam&#39;s body.[4]
Victims[edit]
The victims were:
Klarvatten house: Phu Lam&#39;s wife, Thuy-tien Truong (known as Tien Truong), 35, and her eight-year-old son, Elvis Lam; her father Van-dang Truong, 55; her mother, Thi-dau Le, 55; her sister, Thanh-ha-thi Truong (known as Ha Truong), 33; her sister&#39;s daughter, Valentina Nguyen, 3; Viet Nguyen, 41, Tien Truong&#39;s male friend.
Haddow house: Cyndi Duong, 36.
Perpetrator[edit]
Phu Lam (aged 53) had a criminal record dating back to 1987, which included drug and violence-related offenses.[4] At the time of the shooting, he was in bankruptcy proceedings and owed a large amount of money on at least a dozen credit cards due to a gambling problem.[5] Lam was arrested twice in Edmonton, for sexual and domestic assault. The 9mm handgun used in the shooting was registered in 1997 but was stolen in 2006 from Surrey, British Columbia.[3] In November 2012, a complaint was filed against Lam after he threatened to kill his ex-wife Thuy Tien Truong and five other relatives.[5]

Judge: Nothing in Nanaimo killer’s past could predict these murders
Published April 30, 2020 by Christopher di Armani
Filed Under: Canadian Mass Murders, Crime
This is part of my ongoing series on Canadian Mass Murders.

“By all accounts, Kevin Douglas Addison was a diligent and competent worker. He did not abuse alcohol or drugs. There was nothing in his personal antecedents that could possibly be seen as a precursor to the murderous violence he unleashed on April 30th, 2014.”
— Justice Robin A. Baird
R. v. Addison, 2016 BCSC 2352

Some mass killings cannot be prevented.
This is a deeply disturbing thought, and one nobody wants to face.
We desperately want to believe there is something we could do, something somebody could do, to prevent a heinous tragedy before it happens.
The harsh reality we must face is sometimes, some people do “just snap” and kill people – with no prior warning they’re heading in this awful direction.
According to Justice Robin Baird, Kevin Douglas Addison’s killing spree is one of those terrible times.
“Nothing … could possibly be seen as a precursor to the murderous violence that he unleashed on April 30th, 2014,” wrote Justice Baird in his 2016 reasons for sentencing.
While impossible to predict beforehand, Kevin Addison’s actions were both deliberate and intentional.
He sawed the barrel off his 12?gauge shotgun, taking care to file the edges of the cut barrel so they would not scratch his leg as he walked.
He cut off the stock and removed the hunting dowel from the shotgun’s magazine. He loaded it with five shells, then stuffed his pockets with another handful of cartridges.
Finally, he cut a hole in the right front pocket of his blue jeans so he could conceal the sawed-off shotgun in his pant leg.
There was nothing random or involuntary about Addison’s actions on the fateful morning he murdered Michael Lunn and Fred McEachern and tried to kill two others.
Earl Kelly, who was air-lifted to Victoria General Hospital in critical condition, eventually recovered from his injuries.
“He is feeling very fortunate and at the same time very saddened by the whole event (loss of his co-workers),” Kelly’s family said in a hand-written note released to the press.[i]
Tony Sudar was shot in the face but only suffered minor wounds. He was released from hospital the day after the shootings.
George Rounis, the killer’s brother-in-law, released a statement on May 1st, 2014, offering the family’s condolences to the families of the murdered and injured men.
“We are saddened and devastated by the events that took place in our community at the Western Forest Products Mill. Our deepest heartfelt sympathies and condolences go out to Mr. Mike Lunn and Mr. Fred McEachern’s family, friends and co-workers. We also extend our wishes to Mr. Earl Kelly and Mr. Tony Sudar and their families as they recover from their injuries. We humbly ask that everyone be respectful of all the families affected by these events, including our own, especially the children.”[ii]

The Painful Exception to the Rule
Denial of our individual powerlessness is an understandable response to heinous crimes like this. We hate feeling powerless, let alone being powerless to stop a nightmare before it begins.
Most of the time there are plenty of warning signs a person will resort to violence to address their grievances, whether they are real or imagined.
Kevin Douglas Addison is the exception to the rule.
As we’re learning again with the Nova Scotia mass murderer, the trouble we face as a society is that nobody bothers to report the warning signs when they’re flashing in our faces like a neon sign.
The warning signs were everywhere in the Nova Scotia, but nobody bothered to speak up. As a result, 22 people are dead; 22 families are grieving those terrible losses, and the rest of us are left to wipe away our tears and try to make sense of the senseless.
As incomprehensible as it seems, there were no such warning signs from Kevin Addison, a fact the judge made clear.
I can’t speak for you, but for me the judge’s statement – nothing in Addison’s history hinted he was capable of murder – is the most terrifying sentence of the entire sentencing transcript.

Addison’s Killing Spree
Kevin Addison used to work at the Nanaimo mill but was let go when the company shut it shut down in 2008.
“When the mill started back up, a lot of people wanted to come back, but Addison wasn’t one of the lucky ones who got to,” said mill employee Rex Boden.[iii]
Unbeknown to anyone but the killer, failing to be rehired would fester into a murderous hatred that would leave two men dead and two others seriously wounded.
Early in the morning of April 30th, 2014, Kevin Addison entered the Western Forest Products Mill in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and shot his first victim in the mill’s parking lot before heading inside.
Justice Baird details those events in his reasons for sentencing.
[6]           In November 2010, just shy of two years later, the mill reopened, but with a skeleton crew of only 41 workers. The company had obviously resolved to make a modest start, and to see how things went. Workers were rehired on the basis of seniority. Unfortunately, Mr. Addison was number 42 on the list. Whether it was true or not, Mr. Addison believed, and believes to this day, that management hired people off the street with no mill experience, circumventing the requirements of the collective agreement. He filed a grievance about this which was taken only so far before being abandoned by the union as without merit.
[8]           Mr. Addison’s outward reaction to this setback, however, was unremarkable. He expressed a degree of frustration and upset to his local union chief, but his behaviour was the same as many other workers in the same situation. He never shouted or carried on. He never threatened anybody or swore vengeance. His reaction was typical of any well-adjusted person, and was not in any way disproportionate, aggressive or alarming.
[9]           In fact the jury heard evidence that Mr. Addison put the whole unfortunate business behind him and got on with his life.
In late 2013 Addison fell into a deep depression about not being rehired at the Nanaimo mill, despite having an excellent and well-paying job at a Ladysmith mill operated by the same company, Western Forest Products.
He stopped showing up for work and, despite repeated efforts by both mill and union employees, would not return to work. The out-of-the blue announcement he could no longer work for the Western Forest Products made sense to no one but him.
[15]        Mr. Michael Lunn pulled into a gravel parking lot near the entrance of the mill just as Mr. Addison was walking across it. Mr. Addison shot Michael Lunn dead as soon as he saw him. Without breaking stride, it seemed, Mr. Addison entered the nearby plant administration office, where, in rapid succession, he shot and killed Fred McEachern, and shot and seriously wounded Earl Kelly and Tony Sudar.
[16]        The jury obviously concluded that the evidence of Mr. Addison’s motivations and intentions at the time of these shootings was clear and strong. It may be that Mr. Addison was depressed at the time, and it seems clear that this sort of violence was out of character for him, but there can be no doubt that his acts were consciously and wilfully committed.
[17]        There was also a durable motive established in evidence. Mr. Addison had a grudge against Western Forest Products and, in particular, against three of the men with whom he was principally engaged during this shooting spree — Michael Lunn, Fred McEachern and Andy Vanger. Mr. Addison was convinced, and continues to be convinced, that together these three men ruined his career at the Nanaimo mill. The inescapable conclusion to be drawn from the totality of the evidence is that this conviction had become deep-rooted and ineradicable by late 2013 and early 2014.
[19]        The Crown’s theory was that, over the years, this profound sense of disillusionment turned by degrees into anger and ultimately to murder. According to this theory, which the jury clearly accepted, the April 30, 2014 shootings were entirely intentional and motivated by a desire for revenge.

The Sentence
Kevin Addison has never taken responsibility for killing two men and injuring two others. Throughout his trial he insisted he never meant to kill anyone. He denied shooting his fourth victim entirely. His second and third victims, he testified, where killed and injured when the shotgun “just went off.”
The jury didn’t buy it, and neither did the judge.
[27]        In summary, the jury concluded that Mr. Addison left his house on the morning of April 30, 2014, with a planned and deliberate scheme by which he concealed a modified weapon in his jeans and approached the plant intending to commit murder on arrival. They concluded, and I agree with them, that Mr. Addison intended to kill each of the four individuals upon whom he fired. His actions were precise, calculated, cold, determined, and merciless. He knew exactly what he was doing and why. It is only by grace and good fortune that memorial services were not required for Tony Sudar and Earl Kelly as, sadly, they were for Michael Lunn and Fred McEachern.
Justice Baird sentenced Kevin Douglas Addison to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 25 years for the first-degree murders of Michael Lunn and Fred McEachern.
Because he also tried to kill two people he never even met and could not possibly hold a grudge against, Justice Baird also sentenced Addison to life imprisonment for attempting to murder Earl Kelly and Tony Sudar.
“Mr. Addison will either be locked up in a federal penitentiary or on supervision by the parole board for as long as he lives. He must serve a minimum of 25 years behind bars before he is eligible to be considered for parole, a dispensation that may never be granted.”

This person was going to murder as many as he could and there was nothing that was going to stop it. No regulations, no laws, no OIC in parliament….nothing! It is however interesting that the present government is pushing forward with an agenda that coincides at the same time with Canadians being distracted by and rightly so with C19. Well done Mr PM the puppet of the masters. Okay lets put all the BS aside and address the issue of mental health that provoked this to start with. No miss guided politically driven “red flag laws” in which I partially agree with but not as internally purposed would have caught this atrocity. No feel good laws are going to work. This begs me to ask than what? The creatures who have crawled out of the slimy depths are not helping to assist in solving this complex social issue. You know of what I speak as reported on this blog and in the media. So I will put it out there, despite all the Governments own statistics to the contrary, why take FA’s away from the very people who are the most trusted in society? I am not a criminal as much as I do not drink and drive…. drunk drives kill more people than LEGAL guns. (vehicles kill much more people per annul, even farm equipment kill more) I wish no harm to anyone so please leave me alone. Thank you to Mr di Armanin for allowing me and others to speak our minds.
